            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Author of theſe Sermons having for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years been abſent from this his Native Country (being Paſtor to a Church of Chriſt at <hi>Amſterdam</hi>) may be under ſome diſadvantage as to his eſteem in the hearts of thoſe that fear the Lord, by reaſon that neither his perſon nor his name is well known unto them; And ſo through ignorance or miſapprehenſion they may omit the purchaſe of this Book, which may (through grace) be of much uſe and benefit to their ſouls. Therefore we have thought it meet and a duty, for thy good; to prefix a few words in a way of recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the perſon to thee, that, as his name is ſweet and precious amongſt thoſe Saints and people to whom he Preaches, ſo both himſelf and this his work may be readily and cheerfully received by Thee and others of God's life-breathing ones here in <hi>England.</hi> He is a man ready in the Scriptures, and much acquainted with the mind of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: painful, ſpiritual and powerful in his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conviction, converſion, and edification of many ſouls. Having large experiences of God's goings in, and dealings with his own ſoul in a way of grace by his Spirit; And one who lives in the Spirit, and walks up exemplarily to that light and life which is communicated freely and richly to him by Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, who is the ſoul foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of both. And as for this his work, it carries its own praiſe with it, and needs not our Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; only give us leave to ſay thus much, that it is plain, ſound, ſpiritual, lively, and practical,
<pb facs="tcp:97673:3"/>well ſuited to every capacity. You will find the Text with many other Scriptures, truely and clearly opened; The Doctrines genuinely deduced, rightly ſtated, fully proved and Illuſtrated; doubts aſſoiled; Miſtakes rectified; Errors enervated; Objections anſwered; and the Application faithful, home, ſearching, pathetical, full of perſwaſion and life. In ſum, the Deſign and Endeavour of this ſweet Preacher, in theſe Sermons, is very glorious, <hi>viz.</hi> To diſcover lurking, ſoul beguiling and deſtroying Hypocriſie; To lay open the falſe bottoms that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtand upon for eternity; To bring ſouls to a full and entire cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt by faith, the only foundation of eternal ſalvation; and to entertain and cheriſh the Holy Spirit in its workings; To era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate ſoul-polluring corruption, and further the true mortification of internal boſom luſts: By ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whence and how it is effected; what is the power that produces, carries on and perfects it; And to work up Saints to a living unto God in the life of God, that they may eſcape death and attain at laſt everlaſting life in the viſion of God. The footſteps of which deſign are manifeſtly apparent in theſe Sermons; And the fruits of his faithful and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Endeavours are to be ſeen and read in the hearts and lives of many of his hearers: which, through the bleſſing of God upon thy diligent and ſerious peruſal thereof, may be experienced by Thee alſo; ſo as Thou mayeſt, in Chriſt's ſtrength, come in as a Conquerour over all thy ſpiritual enemies, and joyn with thoſe mentioned in the cloſe of this Book, who have the Palms of victory, and Harps of joy in their hands, to ſing praiſes to the Lord, and ſay, Glory, Honour and Dominion be unto our God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: Father, who hath ſealed and freely ſent his only begotten and
<pb facs="tcp:97673:3"/>dearly beloved Son into the world, that by his death I might have life: Son, who hath finiſhed the work the Father gave him to do, who hath dyed, is riſen again and aſcended, and as a fruit of all, hath received and ſent the Holy Ghoſt to apply and produce that ſpiritual life: And Holy Ghoſt, who as the Comforter is come, and hath ſweetly, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, wiſely, faithfully, and all-prevailingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd that living work in my ſoul. Therefore buy and read this Book; Reading, meditate; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, pray; and Praying, remember</p>

            <p>YOur greateſt good is aimed at in this little Book, Let me ask you a plain but ſerious queſtion, how fareth your Soul, that pretious, that immortal Soul within you? As by natural ſenſe you could ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a like queſtion concerning your Body; ſo by a quick ſpirituall ſenſe may this be anſwered. Chriſt our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Luke 16.11.</hi> of the true riches, outward riches are not the true riches; ſo there is a true health, bodily health is not the true health; <hi>3 Ep. John v: 2.</hi> Beloved (ſaith that beloved Diſciple) I wiſh above all things, thou majeſt proſper and be in health, even as thy ſoul proſpereth; but to the generality there is cauſe to wiſh that they may proſper and be in health as their body proſpereth, for the moſt have far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity &amp; health in their outward than in their inward man. Either you are under the foot of your natural Lusts, or they are in a good degree, under your foot; either you are overcome by them or you overcome them; If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, either you are ſo, and yet ſenſeleſſe and ſecure (which is the miſerable condition of the greater part of men) then here's a word of conviction continuing as you are, the word of truth ſaith you ſhall dy; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible and awake you do ſtrive and ſtrugle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your corruptions without victory, (which is the ſad caſe of many) then here's a rule of direction, all your endeavours againſt your ſin muſt be through the ſpirit. If the latter, if you are victorious over your lusts which war againſt your ſouls (which is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe but of a comparative few) then here's a Cup of
<pb facs="tcp:97673:4"/>conſolation for you, he who cannot ly, ſaith you ſhall live; Take thine own portion, learn thine own Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>In that great day when the Books ſhall be opened, then ſhall this Book with all other have a far more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen publication, and how it came to be printed, and what my end in it is, and what the fruit of it ſhall be, will be revealed; men's writings are called their works, (we ſay the works of ſuch a one and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon) according to theſe works, ſhall it be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, by that juſt, that wiſe Judge, in that day, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who worketh in this kind; I had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore write that which is profitable though not honourable, than that which is honourable and not profitable, or that which is good meanly, than any thing that is evill eligantly. Seeing the Scriptures themſelves are ſo diſlik't, and found fault with by ſo many, no wonder if this piece meet with hard cenſures <hi>Rom. 14.4.</hi> Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own Maſter he standeth or falleth; ſo may it be ſaid of another mans ſervice.</p>
            <p>I have ſometime thought, why did not all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles write ſomething for publick common uſe? or why have we not ſomewhat of the writing of them all? who ſince like them? yet what volumes have been written and preſerved, and brought down to us through the ſeverall ages ſince their time? No doubt more things were written by the Pen-men of Scripture than we have; more Epiſtles by the Apoſtles than are come to us, ſome of which, (it's very like) we would have judg'd mere uſefull, and ſhould have preferred before ſome that we have. (Luke <hi>1.1. For as much as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order a declaration of thoſe things which are moſt ſurely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved among us,</hi> V. <hi>3. It ſeemed good to me alſo, though many,</hi> yea, becauſe many had written, be
<pb facs="tcp:97673:5"/>wrote too, and that about the ſame things.) Had printing been found out in Chriſt's time or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dayes, how much more of their ſayings, doings, and writings might we have had? But God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over-ruleth all things in infinite wiſdome, not to be fathomed by the ſhort line of our reaſon, or underſtanding, How unſearchable are his wayes?</p>
            <p>To ſay the truth, as theſe Sermons were preached upon the deſire of a Friend, ſo are they publiſhed upon the ſerious requeſt of ſeverall, (backt with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſages of providence) and by grave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; otherwiſe I had not any mind, or thought in my mind, to let them paſſe the Preſs, than which even no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther from my thoughts when I preach't them</p>
            <p>As they were delivered in my conſtant courſe of preaching (ſo neer as well could be) come they here to you in a homely dreſſe, <hi>Eccl. 11.6. In the morning fow thy ſeed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand, for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall proſper, either this or that, or whether they both ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good;</hi> So may it be ſaid, read one and read ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book, for thou knoweſt not whether ſhall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thee, either this or that, or whether they ſhall be both alike gainfull, or ſuccesfull. They ſay it's an ill wind that blows no one any good; I am not without hope thoſe things printed may do ſome good (as I have ground to believe when preached they did) If they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come beneficiall to any I ſhall account that alone a great reward, and he that ſhall ſay contemptuouſly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

We read,</hi> Luke <hi>24.11. Their words ſeemed to them as idle tales, becauſe they believed them not;</hi> Pray, O therefore pray much for Faith (leſt theſe words of truth be but to you as idle tales) and therewith mix all the truths of God.

If every idle word ſpoken, must be given an account of, then ſure every good and uſefull word heard or read must be accounted for, <hi>Hoſ. 2.8, 9. She did not know that I gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oyl,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore will I return and take away my Corn, and my Wine, and will recover my Wool and my Flax,</hi> &amp;c. Doth the Lord regard what uſe men put his Corn, Wine, Wool and Flax to? and doth he not obſerve how men entertain, and deal with his Words?</p>
            <p>The good Lord deliver thee from that woſull, yet prevailing frame of Spirit, to be ſerious about trifles and triflng about ſerious things. He in whom are all the Treaſures of Wiſdom, make you wiſe to Salvation, your own, your everlaſting Salvation from the worſt

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Moſes</hi> told the people <hi>he had ſet life and death before them,</hi> Deut. 30.19. upon the account whereof he there <hi>calls heaven and earth to record againſt them,</hi> ſo are theſe two great things Death and Life ſet before us in the Scripture throughout, eſpecially in ſome places, among which my Text is one; what is the great queſtion that all do, or ſhould put and labour to get anſwered? Is it not this? which of thoſe two things ſhall we have? ſhall we have Death, or ſhall we have life? to which grand enquiry, the Apoſtle here from the Lord, gives a ſhort but full anſwer in two conditional propoſitions; The firſt hath the force of a Divine threatning, and is a plain Character of thoſe who ſhall dye: The other car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in it a ſure promiſe from God, and gives a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain note of ſuch who ſhall live. I begin with the firſt,
<q>If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle doth not ſay they who live after the fleſh, ſhall dye; But, <hi>If ye,</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaks home to their Conſciences; It is to be minded to whom this is ſpoken; that may be known by obſerving to whom this Epiſtle was written, Chap. 1.6, 7. <hi>Among whom are ye alſo the called of Jeſus Chriſt, To all that be in</hi> Rome, <hi>beloved of God, called to be Saints.</hi> By the way you may take notice of three things. 1. The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97673:7"/>Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, not the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> v. 1. though the Pope that great

                  </gap> that there he dwelt and <hi>preached in his own hired houſe two years;</hi> beſides it is conſiderable, <hi>Peter</hi> was the Apoſtle of the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, Paul</hi> of the <hi>Uncircumciſion,</hi> and ſo of the <hi>Romans</hi> Chap. 15.15, 16, <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Brethren, I have written the more boldly to you in ſome ſort, as putting you in mind; becauſe of the Grace that is given to me of God, that I ſhould be the Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt to the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, There are divers paſſages in this Epiſtle that ſeem to have been purpoſely expreſt, by the guidance of the Holy Ghoſt, with reſpect to that great Apoſtacy he foreknew would be, and have its chief ſeat in <hi>Rome;</hi> which is the rather to be noted becauſe ſome Jeſuits make uſe of certain expreſſions in it, uttered in commendation of the Chriſtians then at <hi>Rome,</hi> to defend their Sect and Party in their preſent wickedneſs (though the Apoſtle do as much or more commend others to whom he wrote) It is obſerveable in this Epiſtle, the Apoſtle diſputes largely concerning juſtification by faith without works, whereas they now cry up works in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he by way of warning (perhaps alſo of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97673:7"/>Prophecy) tells the <hi>Romans</hi> Chap. 11. that if they <hi>continued nor in the goodneſs of God</hi> (which they have not) <hi>they ſhould be cut off from being a Church of God,</hi> as the Jews were, and Chap. 12.3. <hi>I ſay</hi> (faith he) <hi>through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith.</hi> Now of all men on earth no man doth, or even can tranſgreſs that rule more than the Pope, who boaſteth himſelf to be infallible (at leaſt in his Chan) and to have power to forgive ſins, to diſpoſe of Kingdoms, to diſpence with the Law of God in divers caſes and the like. Oh how highly doth he think of himſelf above what he ought to think, how far are ſuch thoughts from ſobriety? would he think of himſelf according to the meaſure of his faith, muſt he not think himſelf among the meaneſt, if not the loweſt of thoſe who make any profeſſion of the name of Chriſt? Ag. Ch. 13.1. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers,</hi> viz. Magiſtrates, Civil Rulers, it's not ſaid, let all, but every ſoul, yet that great Antichriſt, would have the higheſt powers on earth ſubject to him, and he ſaith they are or ought to be ſo, <hi>he exalts himſelf above all that's called God</hi> (2 Theſſ. 2.4.) I ſhall add only that one place more, Chap. laſt, 17.18. <hi>Now I beſeech you Brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them, for they that are ſuch ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly, and by good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> Who are they that cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, more than they at <hi>Rome,</hi> and their fellow Idolaters, enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt? who do more manifeſtly than the generality of that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97673:8"/>ſort of men, ſerve their own belly? and who by good words and fair ſpeeches (as by other means) do more groſſlly deceive the hearts of the ſimple? Thirdly, obſerve the Apoſtle doth not in the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or ſuperſcription of this Epiſtle, ſay, to the Church which is at <hi>Rome</hi> (as in other Epiſtles he ſaith to the Church in ſuch or ſuch a place) but he ſaith in that firſt Chap. 6.7. v. <hi>To all that be in</hi> Rome, <hi>beloved of God, called to be Saints:</hi> He doth not ſo much as make mention of a Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> much Ieſs doth he ſpeak of it, as the Mother and chief Church, much leſs doth he once mention, or direct his Epiſtle to, a Pope there; No, nor doth he give the leaſt hint of <hi>Peters</hi> being there, or to be there, which moſt probably he would, had <hi>Peter</hi> ever been Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Papiſts conceit, But (ſaith he) <hi>to all,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>called Saints</hi> (as the Greek hath it) not called to be, but called Saints, or Saints by calling, though now they at <hi>Rome</hi> Canonize perſons for Saints, after they have been long dead, and ſpeak as if there were no Saints on earth (being conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perhaps to themſelves that they are far from being ſuch) yet at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, there were called Saints, who were beloved of God; to theſe the Apoſtle directed and ſent this Epiſtle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to theſe he ſpeaks in my Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye beloved of God, called Saints, live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye,</hi> It may ſeem ſtrange he ſhould ſpeak of dying to ſuch as theſe, but the Spirit of truth who guided the Apoſtle in his writing, is the great teacher, and well underſtands himſelf, and to diſlike that which was written by the Spirit, is no ſmall evil; Nor is it ſtrange that the Apoſtle ſhould thus write to ſuch, conſidering how he expreſſeth himſelf, with an If, <hi>If ye live after,</hi> &amp;c. as it's no way improper or unfit to ſay to ungodly men in general, if ye repent, if ye believe ye ſhall live,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97673:8"/>ye ſhall be ſaved, No more hath it any unfitneſs in it, or ſtrangeneſs of ſpeech, to ſay to believers, <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye. As there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſes to unbelievers, ſo conditional threatnings to believers;</hi> and hereby it appears, were that Apoſtle here to Preach as once, divers would not like his preaching, for there are, who love not to hear, but cry down ſuch Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The Doctrinal propoſition which I am to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D.</hi> That if any whoever they are, do, or ſhall live after the fleſh, they ſhall dye, whatever their priviledges or enjoyments are. Five dores I ſhall open, or five queſtions I ſhall briefly Anſwer, to make way for, and let in the Application of this truth, I ſhall ſhew briefly, 1. What's meant by fleſh, and why it's ſo called. 2. What by living after the fleſh. 3. What by dying, ye ſhall dye. 4. How doth it appear that they who live after the fleſh ſhall dye. 5. Why ſhould ſuch Doctrine as this be preached to believers, to Saints by calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. <hi>What's meant by fleſh, and why it is ſo called?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By fleſh here, as oft in other places, corrupt nature is underſtood, or the corruption of nature, as when it's ſaid, <hi>that which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh,</hi> fleſh is oppoſed to the <hi>new man, the new creature, the image of God, the Divine nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And corruption of nature may be called fleſh for divers reaſons, ſuch as theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is derived to us with our fleſh, our body, from <hi>Adom; We have bad,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Fathers of our fleſh who corrected us,</hi> Fathers of our fleſhly part, of our body, and they who are fathers of that, are fathers of our corrupt nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> we have it from them, for when any are conceived, in ſin are they conceived.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97673:9"/>
               <p n="2">2. Corruption of nature is naturally as dear to men as their fleſh, their very body, and as near to them; <hi>No man hates his own fleſh, but cheriſheth it;</hi> ſo no man naturally hates his corrupt nature which he brings into the world with him, but every one cheriſheth and nouriſheth his corruption, and makes <hi>proviſion for it,</hi> (till he be renewed) Yea, how many ſhew more love, more tenderneſs towards their Corruption, than to their very body? how many endure much, ſuffer greatly in their bodies, and venter and loſe not unuſually their life it ſelf, from their love to ſome vile luſt? which is to them as their <hi>right eye, their right hand,</hi> or right foot, and as their life it ſelf; <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life,</hi> only a mans luſt that's many times ſo dear to him, he'l hazard his life to ſatisfie it, rather than lay it aſide, or part with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Corruption grows with the fleſh, and as the fleſh is ſtrong or weak ſo frequently are the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of luſt, hence the Apoſtle ſaith, he <hi>kept under his body,</hi> in fickneſs, in bodily weakneſs, this and that ſin doth not ordinarily move ſo much, or ſtir ſo ſtrongly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Corrupt nature doth never quite ceaſe in any till they lay down, put off the tabernacle of their fleſh, while the beſt are here in the body, much ſin abides in them, the old man will in part remain in all, untill the Tabernacle of their body be quite pulled down to the ground; as we read concerning the Leproſie among the Jews, it getting into their houſes, would not out, till they were took quite down and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Corruption of nature inclines men to do many things pleaſing to their fleſh, and which give the body eaſe, content, and delight; ſo that ſin ſeems a great friend thereto, hence exceſſive eating,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97673:9"/>drinking, ſleeping; hence ſlothfulneſs, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the like, though theſe things are really hurtful to the body, not only as to hereafter, or in their deſert, but in their preſent effect, yet are they pleaſing to it, all which ariſe from corrupt nature.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Corruption prevailing, and reigning, turns the ſoul of man as it were into fleſh, it makes a man's <hi>mind fleſhly,</hi> Col. 2.18. ſo it makes his will, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions all fleſhly, ſo that though the ſoul of man in its own nature be a Spirit (God is the father of Spirits, of mens ſouls that is) yet through inbred ſin it minds not, regards not ſpiritual things, but fleſhly bodily things, which are delightful to the outward ſenſes; Sin when it hath Dominion in a man, makes him to God ward, and the things of God as if he were all fleſh, all body, not ſpirit at all in any part of him, it makes man backward to, heavy and dull in ſpiritual duties, and whatever tends to the Souls good; It makes him dull in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in underſtanding ſpiritual things, it makes him unfit for Communion with God, unfit to receive ſpiritual good, as if he were ſpiritleſs, or had no better ſpirit than that the beaſts have; In many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Luſt takes away the uſe of a mans reaſon, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to act as unreaſonably, irrationally, as if he had not a reaſonable Soul, it makes many a man like <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> when his underſtanding went from him, fitter for the Society of beaſts, than of reaſonable creatures living like themſelves, when a luſt prevailed in the Pſalmiſt, he ſaith, <hi>I was as a beaſt before thee,</hi> and hence graceleſs men under the full power of iniquity, are compared to beaſts in Scripture, and called <hi>Dogs, Swine,</hi> &amp;c.— Sin alſo makes the Soul lyable to (and unleſs ſubdued) it brings the Soul unto death, the worſt death, the ſecond death; though the Soul be immortal in its
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97673:10"/>eſſence and dyes not as the body, yet ſin makes it mortal in a ſenſe, it makes it ſubject to a death of miſery.</p>
               <p>And farther, corruption lyes much in the body, therefore the Apoſtle prays for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that they might be <hi>ſanctified in their body, as well as in their ſpirit,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And may it not be ſaid that corruption is firſt in the body, the body being ſhaped e're the ſoul comes into it? and if the ſoul be (as the Scripture ſeems to teach us) immediately from God, then it is by the body, not by the ſoul, that ſin is propagated; God is the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> but he is not the father of ſin, that the ſoul gets from, by, or upon its union to the body, though its difficult to apprehend how it is. For theſe and ſuch like reaſons the corruption of nature may very fitly and ſignificantly be called fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. What is it to live after the fleſh, how is this Phraſe, live after the fleſh, to be underſtood?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To live after the fleſh, is the ſame with walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the fleſh, ſpoken of ſome verſes before my Text; It is to live an ill life, to live ſinfully, as we ſay ſuch a one doth not live well, he lives an evil life, he lives looſely, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that ſo liveth, doth live after the fleſh. The fleſh gives Councel (as it were) to men ſo and ſo, that they live thus and thus, <hi>I conſulted not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>with fleſh,</hi> and when a man doth order his converſation according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the fleſh, then liveth he after the fleſh, when a man doth thoſe things the fleſh ſaith are beſt to be done. The fleſh hath many <hi>motions,</hi> Rom. 7.5. It's ſcarce ever ſtill, but is moving this way or that way, and when any one, doth follow the evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, when a man acts according to them, then doth he live after the fleſh. Corruption of nature is called a Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. <hi>I find a Law,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97673:10"/>that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me;</hi> which Law he calls, ver. 23. <hi>a Law in his members, and the Law of Sin;</hi> This Law giveth many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, every motion is as a command: Now, when any one obeys the commands of ſin, when he runs on ſins errand, doth the work that ſin commandeth to be done, this is living after the fleſh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Among whom alſo we all bad our converſation in times paſt, in the luſts of the ſteſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh,</hi> or (as the Margin hath it) <hi>the wills of the fleſh,</hi> they who do ſo, who fulfill the wills of the fleſh, theſe men, theſe women, live after the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Yet this muſt be noted, it is not any or every act or acting according to the motions, commands or wills of the fleſh, that is intended in my Text, for then who ſo good in this world, as that he doth not live ſo? No man but doth at times go ſo far along with the fleſh, and doth after its motions and wills, as the Apoſtle himſelf in the place forecited, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he did too much, he ſaith, <hi>he was brought into Captivity to the Law of ſin in his members;</hi> therefore he did ſometimes in ſome things act after the fleſh; but he was far from living after the fleſh, as he alſo himſelf elſe where declareth.</p>
               <p>Wherefore more particularly and diſtinctly, take the Anſwer to this ſecond enquiry in five things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Living after the fleſh imports willingneſs in doing what the fleſh moves to and commands, when a man feeling ſuch or ſuch ſinful motions, doth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly yield himſelf thereto; when a man fulfills with his will, with his heart upon choice, the wills of the fleſh; As no man lives after God (though he do ſuch things outwardly as God commands) except he obeys willingly, with his whole heart, chooſing to do what he doth in obedience to God; ſo a man doth not live after the fleſh, though he do divers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97673:11"/>things the fleſh moves to, except his will be in the doing thereof; Men uſually, live willingly, they live and will to live, they chooſe life, ſo they that live after the fleſh obey its wills willingly, they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do what the fleſh would have them, but they will, they chooſe to do it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.11. Ephraim <hi>is oppreſſed and broken in judgment, becauſe he willingly walked after the Commandment,</hi> i. e. The Kings Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the King was the more pleaſed becauſe they <hi>willingly</hi> walked after his Commandment, which thwarted the Commandment of the Lord, but this provoked God the more, that they not only did ſo, but did it <hi>willingly,</hi> ſo to walk after the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, that's to live after the fleſh; when a man's heart ſaith (though never ſo ſecretly) to the fleſh, thy will be done; Should you hear it ſaid of one, he lives baſely, niggardly, you would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thereby, that he is not conſtrained, but he wills and chooſeth to live meanly, as a poor man, when he's not poor; if a man only follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin as one drawn, drag'd and forced on, really againſt his will, if he be only <hi>as led Captive, brought into captivity to the Law of ſin,</hi> when he can truly ſay, <hi>what I do, I would not;</hi> then he lives not after the fleſh, (though he do ſuch things as are after the fleſh) no more than a man lives niggardly who would fain live in a better faſhion if he could.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Living after the fleſh, ſignifieth acting according to the Law of the fleſh readily, reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wilfully; gracious obeying is to do what God commands <hi>without murmerings and diſputings,</hi> Phil. 2.14. ſo wicked living after the fleſh, is to do what the fleſh commands without reſiſtance or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereto, without any contradiction, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable gainſaying, when a man <hi>ſelleth himſelf to do wickedly;</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14, <hi>He was ſold under fin,</hi> but he doth not ſay or mean that he

If then any do reſiſt the fleſh, if they fight, if they wreſtle againſt it, if they have contrary luſtings to the luſtings of the fleſh, if they ſeek its ruine, if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97673:12"/>their heart riſe againſt its wills, if the commands of the fleſh are contradicted, and diſputed againſt by them, if they like well, arguments, and perſwaſions, calling them off from the way corruption puts them on to, then do they not live after the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, (which is implyed in the former) liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the fleſh, notes affection to the commands thereof, a doing what corruption wills with love thereto, and delight therein. As to live, is that which moſt men, and all naturally affect, deſire, love, and delight in.</p>
               <p>He that liketh, and is pleaſed with the luſtings of the fleſh, he who obeys them with approbation, pleaſingneſs, and pleaſure, his life is after the fleſh, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.7. Babylon <hi>liveth deliciouſly,</hi> ſhe enjoyeth many outward delicacies with delight, with pleaſure; therefore it's ſaid, <hi>how much ſhe lived deliciouſly ſo much torment and ſorrow give her;</hi> ſo when any ſin delightfully, pleaſantly, pleaſurably, when they rejoyce to do evil (as we read the wicked do) when <hi>it's a ſport to them to do miſchief,</hi> they take pleaſure in evil wayes, then live they after the fleſh. If a man do ſome things the fleſh willeth, and his doing thereof be a real trouble, a heart grief to him, if the fleſh its commands be grievous, as the overflowings of the gall very bitter, as the workings of a ſick Stomach; if a man's heart be afflected and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, if it mourn, and ſigh when he is led away at any time by any fleſhly motion, then doth he not live after the fleſh, but rather dyeth after it, or is dead to it, for it is as death to him that he ſins, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.26.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Living after the fleſh takes in conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, continualneſs, doing the will of the fleſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; as while life laſteth, a man liveth daily hourly, though not alwayes alike, and he be not ſtill buſied about the ſame things, but ſometimes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97673:12"/>he's more lively, ſometimes leſt, now he eats, then he ſleeps, ſometimes follows his calling, or talks, or walks; Thus a man who liveth after the fleſh, he is even continually fulfilling one Luſt or other thereof, one way or other, either more or leſs open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vigorouſly, actively, ſtill he acts according to the dictates or movings of ſin within him; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the fleſh commands and moves (which is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, ſometimes leſs ſtrongly, abſolutely, peremptorily and forcibly) ſo he obeys; that is ever commanding ſomthing as there is opportunity, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, temptation, and the man who liveth after it, is even ever doing inwardly if not outwardly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in obedience to its command. When you ſay of a man he liveth after a high rate, he liveth prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, you do not mean that only now and then he makes an extraordinary meal, or is at ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary expenſe, but that in his ordinary courſe he's extravagant, expenſive above his eſtate, ability and quality; ſo to live after the fleſh is not now and then in ſome extraordinary caſe to follow the fleſh, but for a man to act according to it in ordinary.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Living after the fleſh includes continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and perſeverance, as every man liveth till he dyeth, ſo that man who lives after the fleſh and ſhall dye, he doth live after it, till he dye: for if any man hath followed his luſt though very much as before expreſs'd, willingly, freely and wilfully, affectionately, and continually for a long time; yet he at length truely ceaſing while here, ſo to live, if he heartily turn, and alter his courſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that's paſt, <hi>he ſhall not dye,</hi> in the ſenſe of my text, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21.22.</p>
               <p>In a word, if you ſpend your life as the freſh moves you to ſpend it, if you order your converſation, while you live, after the inclinations of that corruption that is in you, then ye ſhall dye. I deſire that this may
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97673:13"/>be well underſtood, what living after the fleſh is (for on your right underſtanding thereof depends you profiting by this truth) two things are neceſſary tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this Doctrine may become effectual, and do us good the one is that we beleive in our hearts that if w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> other is, that we be enlightned rightly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and judge what living after the fleſh meaneth therefore I purpoſe to lay this open more particularly when I come to the uſe of examination.</p>

                  </gap> fleſh? <hi>A.</hi> I ſuppoſe none of you need to be told a meer natural death is nothere intended, ſeeing it's appointed once to all men to dye that death, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their life be. But a ſpiritual dying is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that reſpects the ſoul, and whole man in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Sometimes to dye in Scripture is uſed for being near death, lyable to, or in danger of dying, ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I dye daily, we are killed all the day long;</hi> thus it's true, ye ſhall dye, ye will be in great danger of dying, yea, though ye live after the fleſh only in ſome degree, you'l deſerve death, you'l be deſervedly liable thereto, whenever you do but begin to ſtep after the fleſh, into the hands of death (even the worſt death) will ye fall unleſs infinite mercy prevent. But my Text ſpeaks of more than a bare lyableneſs or danger, as in the following words, <hi>if ye through the ſpirit mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> more is meant than barely a hope of life, ſo, by, ye ſhall dye, more is intended than dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death; ye ſhall dye actually, certainly, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably, but how?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, Ye ſhall dye in this world, as to the loſs of Gods ſpecial gracious preſence, God is our life, ſo far as God leaves us and departs from us, ſo much death; but if we live after the fleſh, God will
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97673:13"/>depart, his <hi>ſoul will depart from us,</hi> Jer. 6.8. He'l leave us as he left <hi>Saul,</hi> who thereupon dyed, before he dyed, becauſe God was gone, his life was gone; ſo God will go from us, he'l draw in the beams of his favour, he'l hide himſelf, he'l take his good ſpirit from us. And thereupon,</p>
               <p>Secondly, You'l dye as to all Spiritual good, that you have or ſeem to have, you will by degrees loſe your light, your convictions, gracious motions, I, and your very profeſſion it ſelf or the livelineſs of it, and that good that may have been in your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, it will be with you at beſt as with the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3.1. if you retain <hi>a name to live,</hi> yet will you <hi>he dead,</hi> dead as 1. Tim. 5.9. <hi>ſhe that liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth,</hi> you'l be <hi>twice dead,</hi> as it's ſaid elſewhere ſome are dead, dead by nature, dead in ſin, and dead as to the loſs of that conviction, that light, that affection, that holineſs they made a ſhew off.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Ye ſhall dye as to inward peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, joy, as Nabal's <hi>heart dyed within him,</hi> it loſt that comfort, mirth it had before, and through grief became as dead, ſo your heart will dye, you'l either have no peace, no joy, or none that's worth the having, none but ſuch as you had better be without, ſuch as is rather the death than the life of the ſoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Sin revived, and I dyed, and the Commandment which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death,</hi> he intends, he loſt his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, hope, peace and joy, ſo ſhall ye dye.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Ye ſhall dye, ye ſhall loſe the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God in all you are, all ye have, and all ye do; whatever any have, without Gods bleſſing, they are dead in the poſſeſſion of it, whatever they do, they are dead in doing it, it is a dead enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a dead work that is not bleſſed of God; life is but a death if it be not bleſſed, every comfort of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97673:14"/>life, is as without life, it's not a living comfort, if not bleſſed to us; but living after the fleſh, removes the bleſſing far from us, and brings a curſe upon us, as it's ſaid <hi>I'le curſe thee in thy basket, in thy ſtore, in all thou ſetteſt thy hand to, and I will curſe thy bleſſings,</hi> there is it not a manifeſt yet a ſecret curſe upon all that live after the fleſh, upon all they have, all they do? which curſe, is a ſore death, all who are curſed, are dead while they live.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If ye live after the fleſh (ſo as hath been declared) ye will at laſt not only dye a natural, but a curſed death, when you come to dye naturally, you'l dye curſedly, wretchedly; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>ye ſhall dye in your ſins,</hi> if you live in them, you ſhall dye in them, under the curſe of God due to them.</p>
               <p>And ſo ye ſhall dye the ſecond death, when your bodies ſhall dye and go to the grave, your ſouls ſhall dye and go to hell, when your ſouls ſhall leave your bodies, God will wholly leave them, when they ſhall be ſeparated from their <hi>earthly Tabernacle,</hi> they ſhall be ſhut out from <hi>that building which is eternal in the heavens,</hi> and from God perfectly, ye ſhall ſo dye, that ye ſhall be killed, and <hi>killed with death,</hi> Rev. 2.23. death will come upon you, and <hi>hell at the heels of it,</hi> Rev. 6.8. So ſhall ye be killed with death, and Devils. In which condition your ſouls will abide to the appearing of Chriſt, and then your bodies ſhall be raiſed to partake with them in miſery, raiſed to <hi>the reſurrection of damnation,</hi> which is oppoſed to the <hi>reſurrection of life,</hi> Joh. 5.29. ſo your whole man, your ſouls and bodies together, will remain in a forlorn, dead; woeful ſtate, without end, for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 4. How doth this appear, how may it be proved, that they who live after the fleſh ſhall dye? <hi>A.</hi> It appears many wayes, by many arguments from Scripture and ſound reaſon, take a hint of ſome.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97673:14"/>
               <p n="1">1. They who live after the fleſh are not truely in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. they who are in Chriſt <hi>walk not after the fleſh,</hi> therefore they who do live after the fleſh are not in Chriſt, they have no intereſt in him, no part in him, ſo they muſt needs dye for not being in Chriſt, they are not under Chriſt's righteouſneſs, they have nothing to do with that, v. 4. <hi>the righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us</hi> (in our nature for us) <hi>who walk not after the fleſh.</hi> Chriſt performed righteouſneſs only for ſuch, It is applyed, accounted to ſuch and no other, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who live after the fleſh are unrighteous in the ſight of God, they ſtand guilty before the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, dye then they muſt, becauſe not partakers of that righteouſneſs which juſtifieth to life; and as they are not in Chriſt, ſo Chriſt is not in them, Chriſt hath not taken hold of them, his ſpirit is not in them, therefore they belong not to him, <hi>they are none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. and if they are none of his, then life is none of theirs, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the bath given to the Son to have life in himſelf, he quickens whom he will,</hi> but none have life from him, unleſs they belong to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They who live after the fleſh, are in the fleſh, they are in its hands, under its power, therefore ſhall dye, as one who is in the hand of his mortal enemy; and while any are <hi>in the fleſh, they cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8.8, and whoever cannot pleaſe God, ſhall not be pleaſed with life by God, but ſhall dye.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To live after the fleſh, is to live in a direct contrariety to God, to his will, his law, his nature; He is a pure ſpirit, not fleſh at all in any ſenſe, much leſs in the worſt ſenſe, he is holy, holy, holy, in him is no darkneſs at all, not any appearance or ſhadow of ſin; ſo that whoever live after the fleſh, do turn their backs upon God, they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97673:15"/>depart, they go far from him, they live moſt dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly contrary to him; how then can they but dye? foraſmuch as God is the <hi>fountain of living waters, the living God;</hi> for they who live not, ſhall dye; none can live unleſs God give them life, God will not give life to any who continue his enemies, to depart from him, in a direct oppoſition to him; Gods ſoul cannot but depart from ſuch, his wrath cannot but be kindled againſt them; ſhall they not then dye? for as, <hi>in his favour is life,</hi> ſo in his wrath is death.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They who live after the fleſh are the ſervants of it, living after it being a doing ſervice to it, the fleſh is their Lord and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſter, therefore they muſt have <hi>the wages of the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 6.16. <hi>his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey, if of ſin, then unto death,</hi> how ſo? v. laſt, <hi>for the wages of ſin is death.</hi> God in juſtice as the Judg of the world is engaged to ſee to it, that they who live to ſin, have the wages of ſin;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uction and miſery are in the wayes of the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 3.16. therefore they who live in thoſe wayes, cannot but dye, as ſurely as he that drinks and continues to drink the moſt deadly poyſon, — He that walks in any way will come to the end of it at laſt, therefore the end of the wayes of ſin bring death, they who continue therein, will ſurely dye in the end, — If the wind blow direct to the ſhore, and the Ship ſail juſt before the wind, the helm not being turn'd, where will it be by and by, will it not be on ſhore, on the ground? if the Boat ſtill continue going down the ſtream, it will be in the Sea e're long, into which <hi>all Rivers run;</hi> the fleſh, that is as the wind, that blows direct hellward, as the ſtream that runs directly into the bottomleſs pit, he that lives after the fleſh, he ſails before the wind, he goes down with the ſtream,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97673:15"/>think then where will he be after a little while, if he turn, if he ſtop not? That which every man <hi>ſows, that ſhall be reap,</hi> reaſon and experience ſay, that's paſt queſtion beyond any doubt, if a man ſow tares, he cannot reap wheat, but muſt have his harveſt of tares, <hi>ſo he that ſowes to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap Corruption,</hi> deſtruction, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Be not deceived</hi> (which intimates many are ſo) <hi>God is not mocked</hi> (couzened, though men oft are ſo) <hi>whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap,</hi> (you know it is ſo outwardly, and ſo it is, as ſure ſpiritually) <hi>for he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap Corruption,</hi> ſpiritual Corruption, which is the worſt.</p>
               <p>Ag. If any live after the fleſh, it hath their heart, it hath ſeized on their heart, it hath poſſeſſion and dominion there, therefore they'l dye: as when a grievous Diſeaſe gets to the heart, ſuppoſe the Plague, if once it get to the heart, you know what follows, unleſs it be ſpeedily expelled or driven thence. Luſt is to the ſoul that which the Plague is to the body, if ye live after the fleſh, the Plague is now already at, in your heart, it hath the command of your will and affections.</p>
               <p>Moreover to live after the fleſh, is to live after Satan, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.15. <hi>ſome are already turned aſide after Satan,</hi> though he be not fleſh in one ſenſe, becauſe he hath no body, yet he is altogether Fleſh in a ſpiritual ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſinful, and he draws thoſe and leads them after the Fleſh, who live after it, they do follow him (though they think not ſo, they know it not) <hi>Eph,</hi> 2.2. <hi>they who walk according to the courſe of this world,</hi> they do walk according to the Prince of the power of the air, ſo v. 3. <hi>they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the deſires or wills of the fleſh,</hi> therefore they ſhall dye, for Satan is a dead creature, and he is reſerved to a farther degree of death and miſery,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97673:16"/>Satan alſo is a deadly enemy to men, he ſeeks with all diligence to entice, allure and draw us to his condition; will he not be killed, who follows a ſubtle enemy that plots his death?</p>
               <p>Shall not he dye who yields himſelf up to his enemies who chriſt to have his blood, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably bent upon his ruine? but thus do they who live after the Fleſh, they yield themſelves up to Satan who (as I may ſay) hath ſworn, and more chan ſworn the death of all he can prevail againſt, and they give up themſelves into the hand of the Luſts of the Fleſh, which <hi>war againſt their ſouls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Dearly beloved abſtain from ſteſhly Luſts, which war againſt your ſouls,</hi> how then can he eſcape death who ſurrenders himſelf thereto?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Thoſe many threatnings of the God of truth againſt ſuch who live in ſin, that he will <hi>whet his Sword againſt them, wound their hairy ſculp, turn them into hell,</hi> Pſ. 9.17. the word into, is doubled in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> either to note the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, as if he had ſaid the wicked ſhall be turned into, yea ſurely into hell, or to ſignifie the greatneſs, and the endleſſeneſs of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhall be turned into, and into hell over head and eats (as we ſay) they ſhall be caſt deep, very deep into the bottomleſs pit, they ſhall ſtill be falling as it were lower and lower, or their ſouls, and at laſt their bodies ſhall be caſt into hell, their ſouls into, and their bodies into hell, or when their bodies into the grave, then their ſouls into hell; and the like. they all demonſtrate and eſtabliſh this truth, ſo ſure as God is true, thoſe threatnings are true.</p>
               <p>So then it is abundantly manifeſt, moſt undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as clear as the Sun, as ſure, as ſure can be, that if we, if any of us all, live after the fleſh dye we ſhall, periſh we ſhall without remedy.</p>

VVHy ſhould ſuch Doctrine be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to believers? <hi>A.</hi> Not as if they who have true faith, ſhall ever any of them ſo live after the fleſh as at laſt to dye the ſecond death, this is not intended, nor implyed, either in my Text, or any other like Sentence of Scripture; for it's certain nothing is meant, or can by right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence be deduced from one place of Scripture, which is contrary to any thing expreſſed in another; but it is expreſſly aſſerted that God who <hi>hath begun a good work in his people will perform, carry it on, to the day of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6. he that layes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true grace in any ſoul, will go forward with his work, till he hath laid the top ſtone, and that becauſe <hi>he is faithful,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.8, 9. <hi>Who ſhall alſo confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by whom ye were called unto the fellowſhip of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> ſo, 1 Theſſ. laſt, 24, and 2 Theſſ. 3.3. and as God is faithful, ſo it's ſure he is able, otherwiſe he would never have begun his work in us, as may be argued from thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28, 29, 30. <hi>which of you intending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down firſt, and counteth the coſt whether he have ſufficient to finiſh it? leſt haply after he hath ſaid the foundation, and is not able to finiſh it, all that behold it, begin to mock him, ſaying, this man began to build and was not able to finiſh.</hi> How much wiſer is God than man? none
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97673:17"/>ſhall have cauſe to mock him, therefore he both can and will finiſh his building the Church, and the work of grace in every one of his effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called ones.</p>
               <p>But why then is it ſaid to Believers: If ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. All Believers are not ſuch in truth, all who make a profeſſion, have not been under the power of God to their ſaving Converſion; when God <hi>ſows wheat,</hi> the Devil <hi>ſows tares,</hi> when God makes true Converts, the Devil makes Hypocrites, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.38, 39. Hypocrites eſpecially are the Devils Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the tares are the Children of the wicked one, all wicked ones, are Children of that wicked one, chiefly Hypocrites, theſe are as his firſt born, and have moſt of his likeneſs. There ever were, and will be, during the ſtate of things, ſuch as <hi>Judas, Symon Magus, Demas,</hi> &amp;c. hereafter all ſuch ſhall be <hi>gathered out of Gods Kingdom,</hi> No Hypocrite ſhall be in the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> but now there are <hi>fooliſh as well as wiſe Virgins, workers of iniquity who hear Christs word, and eat and drink in his preſence,</hi> at his Table; with reſpect to this it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full there ſhould be ſuch Doctrine Preached now in the Church, ye ſhal dye if, <hi>&amp;c</hi> the rather becauſe men know not the hearts of thoſe to whom they Preach, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. laſt, <hi>Then ſhall ye return and diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the righteous and the wicked,</hi> now there is not a certain Infallible diſcerning; and falſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound hearted ones are frequently very confident of their ſtate, that it is good, that it is ſafe; As men in a dream while dreaming are very confident of this or that concerning themſelves, the contrary whereto they find true when they awake; hence this truth is to be taught to awaken ſuch if it may be; and to ſhew them their great and ſad miſtake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though it ſhall never be (becauſe of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97673:17"/>Gods faithfulneſs, as alſo becauſe of Gods election, Chriſt's death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (that true Believers ſhall ſo live after the fleſh, that they ſhall periſh, yet the thing is poſſible in it ſelf, and as to themſelves. Did not <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency fall, and come under the ſentence of death? ſo would the beſt men fall into perdition, if left to themſelves; as <hi>Peter</hi> had ſunk quite down and drowned, if left to himſelf, and when he denied Chriſt ſo far, he had denied him utterly. Corruption becauſe natural, hath great advantage againſt grace in us, and Satan by all means layes about him, to draw it forth, ſo that if we had no keeper, no guid, or better Pilot than our ſelves, we ſhould live after the Fleſh, and ſplit, daſh in pieces on that rock; therefore that none may have confidence in themſelves, but all of us be kept conſtantly <hi>truſting in the living God,</hi> in Chriſt the power of God, and that we may not be <hi>high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but fear,</hi> hence the Apoſtle having given that exhortation, Rom. 11.20 <hi>be not high minded but fear,</hi> he adds v. 21, 22. <hi>if God ſpared not the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral broaches, take heed leſt he ſpare not thee, behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God, on them that fell, ſeverity, but towards thee, goodneſs if thou continue in his goodneſs, otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> As a Mother leading her little Child, it goes towards the fire or water, and though ſhe hold it faſt, ſure, that it ſhall not fall in, yet to make it careful, ſhe ſaith take heed, if you fall into the fire, you'l be burn't, if into the water you'l be drowned; ſo that we may not be ſecure and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and ſelf confident, we have divers ſuch If's in Scripture ſpoken to Gods Children.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, True Believers may have, and too oft have (through compliance with the Fleſh) great falls, though they live not after the Fleſh, they act much according to it, therefore to cauſe them to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97673:18"/>maintain a continual ſight againſt the Fleſh, and to keep at the fartheſt diſtance from it, and to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them to repentance when they have turned aſide, therefore are they to be put in mind what an enemy the Fleſh is, even ſuch that if they do live after it they ſhall dye eternally, and ſo far as they act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, they do dye ſpiritually. For ſuch reaſons as theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>If we ſin wilfully,</hi> (he faith not you, but we, <hi>if we ſin wilfully</hi>) <hi>after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment,</hi> &amp;c. that is, even for us, if we ſo ſin.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, is this a ſit and proper argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to work upon true Believers to keep them from the wayes of the fleſh, or to bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance when they are ſeduced thereby? ſhould not ſuch rather have other things Preached to them? <hi>A.</hi> Other things ſhould be Preached, and that chiefly, as the death of Chriſt, love and grace of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this alſo, ye ſhall dye if, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all conſiderations are needful in this world to keep us awake; God thought it a proper and fit argument to lay before <hi>Adam</hi> when he had no Fleſh, no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in him, <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye;</hi> why then is it not a proper and fit argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be propounded to thoſe who have much ſin remaining in them? though they being in Chriſt, are not under that Covenant, under which <hi>Adam</hi> was, and cannot fall as he did, yet is this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather more ſuitable to them, than to <hi>Adam,</hi> even the argument of death, in this reſpect, becauſe they have much Fleſh in them, which both in it ſelf deſerves death, and enclines them, or moves them to walk in the wayes thereof; ſweet arguments may more take with the renewed part, but this may more curb, remaining Corruption, and work upon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97673:18"/>the heart when in a fearleſs, careleſs frame; and if the ſoul be in never ſo good a frame, to hear that they who live after the Fleſh ſhall dye, may ſtir it up to thankfulneſs, that through and in Chriſt it is ſecure, and the more thankful, the more obedient ſhall we be to God; If any ſay that grace moſt works upon them, I anſwer, the more any are drawn by Grace, the leſs do they need to be driven by this truth, yet even this truth minds us of, and ſets forth to us the grace of <hi>God, in that, but for it, we had all lived after the fleſh,</hi> and there is love in this very truth, that the Lord is thus pleaſed to warn us. It may again be ſaid, but is this right, to avoid or turn from the wayes of the Flaſh, becauſe they bring to death? <hi>A.</hi> We are bound to believe all the word of God, and it's the nature of true faith to Believe all, <hi>believing all things ſaith the Apoſtle that are written in the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Acts 24.14. therefore all Scripture truth is to be Preached, and whatever we do in faith, from true faith, is as ſo, well done, and acceptable to God, as Noah's buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an Ark, becauſe <hi>through faith he was moved with fear,</hi> &amp;c. beſides, death implyes ſeparation from God, and this is very good, it is love to God, to avoid ſin, that by it we may not be ſeparated from him.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. Whether do you, or any of you live after the Fleſh? It is as great a queſtion as whether you ſhall dye; Be the more inquiſitive each one as to himſelf, becauſe multitudes are ſtrangely miſtaken; ſome ſeem as if they did live after the fleſh, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before God they do not, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 10.2. <hi>I beſeech you, that I may not be bold with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold againſt ſome, which think of us, as if we walked according to the fleſh,</hi> the Apoſtles themſelves ſeemed to ſome ſo to walk,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97673:19"/>yet were they far from ſo walking. On the other hand there are, and that many more, who make a ſhew as if they did not live after the fleſh, yet in truth, after it do they live. Thus men alſo miſtake concerning themſelves, thinking that of themſelves which is contrary to truth. It's like if the queſtion were put in the general to any of you, whether think you not there are ſome here preſent who live after the Fleſh, you would every one ſay (if you ſhould ſpeak your thoughts) yes, ſome here do ſo live, or I fear there are ſome whoſe life is ſuch; but let every one be ask'd as to his own particular, probably he would ſay, I do not, or I hope I do not live after the Fleſh. I beſeech you, Brethren, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not your ſelves, for if you do thus live, whether you think ſo, or no, of your ſelves, you will find this true that ye ſhall dye. I would be helpful to you in this enquiry, for which purpoſe I ſhall (briefly offer) divers things to your ſerious thoughts, to be made uſe of in ſelf examination, I ſay, ſelf exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for you know it's not that, God requires of you, nor that, which concerns you, (or not ſo much) to try others, as each one himſelf, and her ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whoever hath not had a great change in his heart, a mighty turn, he doth live after the Fleſh, however he may ſeem to live, for all by nature <hi>are dead in their ſins,</hi> and the <hi>uncircumciſion of their Fleſh,</hi> Col. 2.13. all naturally are born of Fleſh, and are Fleſh, having no good thing in them; <hi>and if the tree be bad, the fruit cannot but be bad alſo,</hi> if any are dead in the Uncircumciſion of their fleſh, it's certain they live after it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To live in the doing of any of the works of the Fleſh, though it be but in ſome one or two of them is to live after the Fleſh. <hi>Q.</hi> What are the works of the Fleſh? <hi>A.</hi> They are very many,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97673:19"/>and they are all or moſt of them very <hi>manifeſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. <hi>The works of the Fleſh are manifeſt,</hi> they are manifeſt to Conſcience, to right reaſon, as declared in Scripture, and becauſe they ſo abound in the world, they may eaſily be known by thoſe who have a mind to know them; and he there reckons up about 16 or 17 of them, which you ſhall do well, to read again and again, and pondering ſeriouſly, thereby to try your ſelves; The works of the fleſh (ſaith he) are manifeſt, which are theſe, <hi>Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, Envyings, Murders, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like.</hi> Though he mention ſo many, yet he adds, and ſuch like, intimating thoſe named, are but ſome; the Fleſh is exceeding fruitful, it hath a numerous iſſue, a great ſwarm of brats, an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of vile fruits. Now, if there be any one of us, any man or woman here, who liveth in any one of thoſe works, or in any ſuch like thing, ſuch a one liveth after the Fleſh; though thou avoid and (after a ſort) hate drunkenneſs, witchcraft, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if thou liveſt in ſome other of thoſe works, if in hatred, if in variance, if in emulations, or wrath, or ſtrife, or hereſies, or envyings, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, or any ſuch other, thou, even thou, doſt live after the Fleſh, and conſequently ſhalt dye (unleſs thou ſpeedily repent) therefore the Apoſtle adds, v. 21. of that Chap. <hi>of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in time paſt</hi> (you need to be oft told, and can hardly be told too often) <hi>that they who do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If you live in the doing any work of the Fleſh inwardly, though not outwardly, to the eye of others, yet do you live after the Fleſh in the eye
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97673:20"/>of God; If your affections are ſtill working accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh, and you give way thereto, though they break not forth, or ſeldom in open actions to be taken notice of by men, If the fleſh command this and that affection in you, your love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, your hope and fear, your joy and ſorrow, as if any one live in love of money, in heart covetouſneſs, though he do not ſuch things, as others, Neighbours, Acquaintance can charge him with, if thy heart be ſet upon the things of the world, if thy comfort come in only from them, if the ſtream, the main chanel of thy deſire run out to them. The Apoſtle calls the things of this life carnal, 1 Cor. 9.11. <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great matter, if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi> why calls he theſe things carnal, not only becauſe they are of uſe to our bodies, but perhaps alſo becauſe they are ſuch things as carnal hearts take up, and are ſatisfied with. Or, if a man live in pride of heart, being as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>vainly puffed up by his Fleſhly mind,</hi> though <hi>with outward voluntary humility.</hi> Or if the fleſh have the rule of a man's thoughts, then doth he live after the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>they that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh,</hi> their minds are kept going, ſtill ſet on work by the fleſh, as the mill by wind, or water.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If in any thing you live contrary to your Conſciences, then you live according to, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, Conſcience ſaith you muſt not act ſo or ſo, yet you do, and will, this is your way, your courſe to contradict Conſcience; It's true the beſt in this life ſometimes diſpleaſe their Conſcience by ſome things they do croſs to its Councels and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, ſo that they have ſmiting of Conſcience as <hi>David</hi> had; but if this be the practiſe of any to walk diſobediently to their Conſcience, this is liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Fleſh, therefore the wrath of God (we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97673:20"/>read <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.) <hi>is revealed from Heaven, againſt ſuch who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> that is, who walk contrary to their Conſcience, what though you pleaſe men, pleaſe your Neighbours, Friends, Relations, if you diſpleaſe your Conſciences, this is fleſhly and deadly. Whatever is contrary to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that as ſo, is of the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>He that lives after God <hi>doth exerciſe himſelf to keep a good Conſcience in all things,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he did, he that doth not ſo, lives after the Corruption of his heart; It is a matter of great conſequence to be well skil'd in diſcerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Law of ſin, to know what is of the fleſh, and what not, this may be known by the Law of God, and of Conſcience; there are indeed divers things that are of the fleſh, which are not againſt ſome mens Conſciences, becauſe their Conſciences are bribed, blinded, ſeared, or not rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but whatever is againſt Conſcience, if done, as ſo done, is from the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They live after the Fleſh, who live in the neglect of thoſe things, the Fleſh would not have them to do, as the Fleſh wills ſome things to be done, ſo it wills other things not to be done, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lord gives negative as well as poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſo doth the fleſh; as God ſaith thou ſhalt do this, thou ſhalt not do that, ſo the Fleſh enjoyns and prohibits or forbids, it moves to, and pulls back from, the doing divers things; Now I ſay, when a man lives in the neglect of thoſe things which are againſt the wills of the fleſh, they live after it; but what are thoſe things? <hi>A.</hi> Whatever God poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commands, that the Fleſh commands negatively; God ſaith, pray continually, the Fleſh faith, pray nor at all, or only now and then; God ſaith, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me fervently, the Fleſh ſaith, be not fervent in the Duties you perform; God ſaith, look well
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97673:21"/>to your ſouls, <hi>above all keepings, keep thine heart,</hi> ſeek the good of your ſouls above all the world, prize eſteem them more than all the world, for ſo much is implyed, in thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> the Fleſh ſaith, never mind your ſouls, or be leaſt careful about them; God ſaith, ſeek firſt my Kingdom, and the righteouſneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Fleſh ſaith, ſeek not thoſe but other things firſt, time enough hereafter for ſuch things; God ſaith, be careful to maintain good works, the Fleſh ſaith, goods, are better than good works, money is better than charity, therefore trouble not your ſelves about ſuch works, wrong not your ſelves by your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, empty not your purſe by your liberality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which of theſe two Lords are you wont to hear and obey in theſe and ſuch like things, the bleſſed Lord God, or that curſed Lord, the Fleſh? Though you do no body any wrong, though you are neither Drunkards, unclean, envious, malicious, nor wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; yet if you uſe to forbear doing the things the Fleſh bids you not do, what are you, but ſervants of the Fleſh? As it is as true, as much obedience to God to avoid, what he forbids, as it is to do, what he enjoyns, ſo is it as truly obedience to the Fleſh, to paſs over thoſe things it prohibits, as it is to do what it moves you to.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, They live after the Fleſh, who are lively in ſinning and that ordinarily; all ſin, but all are not lively in ſinning; when any are alive in the doing of evil, as in their element, they ſin with livelineſs, theſe are like to dye, eſpecially if they are lively in ſinning, and they uſe to be as without life, lifeleſs in ſerving God; they are lively in ſpeaking idely, vainly, but dead hearted in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes about ſpiritual matters; lively in reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, revileing, back-biting, but dead hearted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97673:21"/>counſelling, exhorting according to rule; lively in murmuring, repining, but dead hearted in praying to and praiſing God; lively in hearkning to evil or vanity, ſwift to hear what's fooliſh and ſinful, but dead ſlow in hearing the things of God, and of ſalvation; ready to evil, and backward to good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. laſt, <hi>to every good work repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;</hi> yea, if a man be lively in worldly affairs, outward buſineſſes, and as without life in ſpiritual ſervices, and this be a man's daily or ordinary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he lives after the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, They live after the fleſh moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who boaſt, glory in the fleſh, or any works of the fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 19. <hi>they glory in their ſhame, they mind earthly things, their end is deſtruction.</hi> They glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in what they have got of the world, thus much they have, ſo and ſo rich they are, ſo they thrive in their trade, which is their ſhame, conſidering that though they gain much outwardly, they being worldly perſons, gain nothing ſpiritually; while they are rich towards men, they are poor towards God, they thrive in their earthly, but not in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly trade, or elſe becauſe that they gain of the world is got unjuſtly, by bribery, by extortion, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, or ſome wayes of covetouſneſs, therefore it is their ſhame, and they glorying, be it in their words or thoughts, with their mouth, or their heart, or both, they do glory in their ſhame; whoever glorieth in any ſin, or in any thing won, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſin, as ſo glorying, it is in his ſhame. Some they glory in their exceſſive drinking, other's in their ſwearing, others in their over reaching, ſome in their lewdneſs and filthineſs, others in their perſecuting, others in their Idolatrous or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious wayes; <hi>Gal.</hi> laſt, 12.13. <hi>As many as deſire to make a fair ſhew in the Fleſh, they conſtrain you to be circumciſed, only least they ſhould ſuffer perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97673:22"/>for the Croſs of Christ, for neither they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who are circumciſed keep the Law, but deſire to have you circumciſed, that they may glory in your Fleſh.</hi> When they had conſtrained others to be circumciſed (which was their great ſin) then they gloried in it. How frequent is this for men to ſin, to cauſe others to ſin, to oppoſe good, to hinder the work of God, to further evil, to do miſchief, and when they have done, they glory in it. Let all ſuch expect death.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, They live after the Fleſh, who live after a fleſhly rule, there are divers rules the Fleſh teacheth men to live according to, <hi>viz</hi> their own will, imagination or phanſie, the pleaſing bodily ſenſes, cuſtom, example of men, theſe with other, are the rules that the fleſh teacheth men to live by, yea, education it ſelf though not very bad in it ſelf, or Conſcience it ſelf, is a fleſhly rule, or any other thing, if look'd to, and followed without reſpect to the Word of God, without conſideration of, or regard to the Divine Law. If then any thing be your rule, unleſs with an eye, and inſubordination, to the will of God revealed in his Word, you live after the fleſh, for that which gives you your copy is your Teacher, Maſter; that which gives you your rule is your Lord, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Peace,</hi> happineſs, is only for them <hi>who walk according to this rule,</hi> that is, the rule of Scripture, of God in this Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>If they ſpeak not</hi> (ſo if they live not) <hi>according to the Word, this law and teſtimony of God. It is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> the fleſh reigns in them, which is darkneſs, in which there's no true light at all.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, They live after the Fleſh, who do what they do, though in it ſelf good, from carnal fleſhly principles, to a carnal fleſhly end, ſuch as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are from which we act, and ſuch as the end is, to which we live, ſuch is our life.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97673:22"/>
                  <p>What are fleſhly principles? <hi>A.</hi> They are fear of Man, or tear of God which is not accompanied with, and rooted in love, pride of heart, love of money, love of the praiſe of men, if a man be acted by ſuch like principles, if he allow them, then he lives after the Fleſh. Or if a man's end be fleſhly, his aim in what he doth be taken by the direction of the fleſh, as if it be, meer ſelf; if outward good; honour, eſteem with men, worldly gain, or barely to quiet Conſcience, if our deſign be for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch things, and not to honour God, and pleaſe him; then though we abound in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, religious performances, yet are we livers after the Fleſh before God, as really as they who live in the moſt abominable Luſts of the Fleſh. For the fleſh hath the command and government of our hearts, if our principle and end in acting be of and from the fleſh, though the thing in it ſelf conſidered which we do, be contrary to the Fleſh, yet is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſerved and pleaſed.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, Whoever lives not after the ſpirit, doth live after the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. there's no <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,</hi> there's no middle between theſe two, when any ceaſe living after the fleſh, they begin to live after the ſpirit, when any come from under the power and dominion of corruption, they do come under the power and dominion of grace, holineſs, and the ſpirit of God; either therefore the ſpirit of grace rules and bears ſway in us, or we do live after the Fleſh. Thus much for the firſt uſe, let not theſe things be ſpoken in vain, make application of them to your ſelves, try your ſelves by them, pray over them, reſt not till you know what your life is, how it is that you do live, for this is one Word of God by which we ſhall be judged hereafter, when the great Judge ſhall come to execute the final, diſmal Sentence of Death, then will it be enquired and publiſhed who have lived after the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Let the ſecond Uſe be to convince thoſe whoſe life is after the fleſh of their miſery, art thou ſuch a one, and yet doſt think thou ſhalt not dye, not dye the ſecond, the worſt death? thou deceiveſt thy ſelf, thou doſt contradict my Text, belye the Word of the Lord, ſo art thou the more guilty, and while ſenſeleſs of thy miſerable ſtate, that thy ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs is a bar to thy repenting. How art thou like to turn, who walkeſt in the way of Death, and wilt not believe it is ſuch a way, or that thou art in it? No wonder if all calls are ineffectual, though God ſaith <hi>turn ye, turn ye, why will ye dye?</hi> yet thou art <hi>like the deaf Adder.</hi> Therefore let me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee who doſt live after the fleſh, to receive this as a truth, (though uncomfortable, yet profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97673:23"/>ſhouldeſt thou dye preſently a natural death, thou wouldeſt in dying, dye; dying naturally, thou wouldſt dye everlaſtingly, and unleſs thou liveſt a new life thus will it be whenever death comes, It will come double, when a viſible death ſhall arreſt thy body, an inviſible death will arreſt thy ſoul, even thine, for God will ſtand to his word, he will not forget any one word that he hath ſpoken by any of his Servants, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.26. <hi>he confirmeth the word of his Servant, and performeth the counſel of his Meſſengers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God never goeth back from any word that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely uttereth, as this, without any <hi>If,</hi> expreſſed or intended, only this if ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye, certainly, unavoidably. It is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable God is able to execute his word, he is able (as Chriſt ſaith) <hi>to deſtroy ſoul and body.</hi> If a man, a beaſt, a ſmall creature, a very gnat, or a diſeaſe can kill thy body, how much more can he who made thee, kill thee, ſoul and body, deſtroy thee with an everlaſting deſtruction; what are we to the Angels that ſinned? yet the Lord God hath clapt them all (though many Legions, though migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpirits, though very ſubtle and cunning) he, that almighty only wiſe one, hath put them all under everlaſting chains of darkneſs; How able then is he to cruſh us as moths, to trample under his feet us poor worms, to break us as <hi>a Potters Veſſel?</hi> and as God is able to fulfill his threatning, ſo is he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do it, his word tells us his ſetled purpoſe, his eternal will, and unalterable Counſel; as his threatnings are written in the ſame book with his promiſes, ſo have they the ſame confirmation, his oath, as well as his bare word and determinate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <hi>Am.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn by the excellency of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſurely, I'le never forget any of their works,</hi> I'le, that is, eternally puniſh impenitent ſinners,

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:97673:24"/>did, who periſh'd all together. Shall ſinners prayers, ſhall all that they can do, or ſay, ſave them?

God declares, <hi>though they make many Prayers he'l not hear,</hi> whereof Chriſt alſo gives aſſurance, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying before hand, when they ſhall hereafter ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> &amp;c. he'l ſay, <hi>depart, I know you not.</hi> Shall the mercy of God ſave ſuch? No, for it is holy, faithfull mercy, therefore cannot ſave any againſt his word. How ſure then is the death of all who live after the fleſh? Therefore if thou ſo liveſt, and yet thinkeſt, thou ſhalt not dye, thou art deceived by ſin, by Satan, yea, thou art a ſelf deceiver, and wilfull in thy deceiving thy ſelf. Do ye not know? I pray, remember this day; God ſaid to <hi>Adam, in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye,</hi> but he deceived by Satan thought, though he did eat, he ſhould not dye; Now doth not woful experience to this day teach us, the truth of Gods Word? for, hence we were all born in ſin, hence the grave ſo filled with the bodies of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, hence the world ſo full of miſery, as now, and as it hath been in all ages, hence you women bring forth in ſorrow, hence we men get our bread with the ſweat of our brows, hence all our labour, all our toyl, hence the earth brings forth bryars, and thorns, hence all afflictions. And as ſure as that word prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed true which God ſpake to <hi>Adam</hi> (notwithſtanding what Satan inſinuated to the contrary) ſo ſure is this word true, if thou O man, if thou O woman, liveſt after the fleſh thou ſhalt dye, whatever Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan may whiſper in thee to the contrary; wherefore ſhut thine ear, to all thoughts that contradict this truth, and take it into thy heart, as that which all who are diſobedient, will feel at laſt to be moſt true.</p>
                  <p>I might here deſire you to think, or ask you what you do think in your ſouls, whether (in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97673:25"/>you think not, (this word being true,) there be not a multitude of poor creatures, high and low, rich and poor, who are woefully deceived? Doth it not appear there are great ſwarms and droves of men and women, many and many in all places, who live evidently after the fleſh, yet, who (almoſt) but thinks he ſhall eſcape death, though he live as he doth? How ſad is this? O ſadneſs, lamentation, that ſo great a number of our father <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children are ſo deceived, not taking warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his being deceived! and Alas, alas, that ſuch a number of people muſt dye, eternally dye, even all that multitude who live after the fleſh; Did you hear of a 1000, or a 100, to be executed on the Scaffold, to be broken upon the wheel; would not your bowels earn? ſhould you not be much troubled? and ſhall not this move you, and cauſe you to weep and pray much, to hear from the word of truth, that all thoſe many and many who live after the fleſh, ſhall dye the ſecond death, be tormented in that lake which burns with fire and brimſtone, for ever, and ever. Ah, how great our unbelief? how little our love to thoſe made of one blood with us? how rocky our hearts? O our want of bowels, that this affects us no more! But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Hear me, O precious, immortal ſoul, every one who lives after the fleſh, give ear, turn, O turn, repent, O repent, (I beſeech thee for thine own good, for thy greateſt good) Live a new life, that thou mayeſt not dye. Be not angry with the Word of God, be not angry with him that ſpeaks it, but be angry with thy ſinful life, God ſaith <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.18. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs at the ſame time when</hi> Gog <hi>ſhall come againſt the Land of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith the Lord God) <hi>that my fury ſhall come up in my face,</hi> ſo, when any luſt ſtirs in thee, and warreth againſt thy ſoul, O let thy fury come up in thy face, deal with it, as with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97673:25"/>thy worſt enemy; be entreated, ſo to love thy ſelf as to turn over a new leaf, to write after a new Copy, Turn thy face from the fleſh, turn thy back upon it. Should I tel you that if you live after ſuch a cuſtom, ſuch an old new faſhion or the like, ye ſhall dye by the hand of man, would you not be perſwaded to leave that cuſtom, that faſhion, and thank me for my pains in perſwading you? can you think dying by the hand of man, worſe than dying by the hand of God? is not the hand of the Almighty heavier than the hand of man? have you not heard? have you not read what the Apoſtle ſaith? <hi>It's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> even of him <hi>in whom ye live, and move,</hi> and do you not believe he ſaith true, that it is ſo indeed?</p>
                  <p>Truely, friend, if thou art one who liveſt after the fleſh, it is a wonder thou art not actually dead, under the ſecond death already, in the paws, Jaws of everlaſting death, that that is not now at this day feeding upon thee; but God hath ſpared thee hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, why, why, thinkeſt thou is it? Is't not that thou mayeſt repent? Yes, <hi>the long ſuffering of God,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>is ſalvation,</hi> and ſo thou thouldeſt account, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>account that the long ſuffering of our God is ſalvation, even as our beloved brother</hi> Paul <hi>alſo, according to the Wiſdom given unto him, hath written unto you,</hi> Rom. 2.4. or <hi>deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee to repentance?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is not this mercy? O great mercy that yet, that after ſo long a time, God waits for thy turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thou haſt once again a fair warning. How woefully guilty wilt thou be of thine own death, if being thus warned, thou ſhalt turn a deaf ear? How inexcuſable wilt thou be? whatever thou ſhalt plead for thy ſelf, It will be anſwered, thou wert plainly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97673:26"/>told what would be the end of thy fleſhly life; thou thoughteſt thou ſhouldſt not dye, but thy thought contradicted that word of truth which was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee. Doth not this word ſound terribly in thine ears, thou ſhalt dye, dye in thy ſoul, dye in thy whole man, dye a death of the greateſt, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable miſery, dye eternally? why then, let it awaken thee to repentance; how canſt thou ſleep in thy ſin, how canſt thou reſt and be quiet, with ſuch a terrible word ſounding in thine ears? will not dying it ſelf, be far more dreadful, than to hear of it, is, or can be? I ſhall not now ſtand to uſe more words, if any ſoul will not hear, the blood of ſuch a one will be upon his own head; and let me mind thee, my friend, that the longer thou liveſt in thy ſin, before death comes to thee, the more ſore, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and tormenting will it be when it comes. I wonder what impenitent ſinners think, of that word, Rom. 2.5. <hi>But after thy hardneſs and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent heart, treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deeds,</hi> wilt thou believe it, and turn from the wayes of the fleſh? If not, thou muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it, and ſhalt find it to be as true, as he is true whoſe word it is.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſome one may think, Is there hope, yet hope for me, after all my ſinning for ſo long a time? <hi>A.</hi> There is a certain hope, haſt thou a mind, a heart, to turn in good earneſt? lift up thy head, fear not, doubt not. Turn heartily, God is ready to receive thee, and he will receive thee graciouſly, for ſo he hath promiſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Come out from among them</hi> (come away in thy heart and life from all that live after the fleſh) <hi>touch not the unclean thing,</hi> (Let thy repentance be thorow and ſound) what then, if I ſo turn who will receive me? God
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97673:26"/>anſwers, <hi>I will receive thee,</hi> I will, that is, receive thee graciouſly, <hi>I</hi> will receive thee to my mercy, into the boſome of my grace, as the Prod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

If thou deſireſt yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture to encourage thee, read and ponder that word full of ſweetneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. and be aſſured Jeſus Chriſt hath dyed, that thou mightſt not ſee death, not taſt the worſt death, or feel the curſe of death, if thou turn'ſt from the fleſh to God in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Let me preſs you all to take great heed that you never at all live after the fleſh, never take one ſtep after it; Beware, my Brethren, beware of that fleſh that is within you, of that corruption that is in you, becauſe it is ſo dangerous to live after it, it is a deadly thing, it is a ſubtle, deceitful thing,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97673:27"/>alluring, enſnaring and powerfully moving, let us all be very watchful againſt it. conſider a few words.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſo far as you give way to the fleſh you'l hinder your aſſurance; what aſſurance (conſidering this truth) can I, or you have, unleſs our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience acquit us, and bear witneſs in us, that we live not after the fleſh? but you, Chriſtians, know the worth of aſſurance, ſay, is it not a ſad thing to have your aſſurance (though but in ſome degree) weakened, clouded? is it not very ill to have your evidences blotted, to have any ground, or ſo much as ſeeming cauſe to doubt concerning your ſtate, and to fear that you are among them that ſhall dye; They who know not what it is to dye ſpiritually, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly, may be in a ſtate of death, and make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but you who underſtand what this dying meaneth, cannot live comfortably, without good aſſurance that you ſhall not dye. O let there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the reprobates mark found upon you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, So far as you yield to the fleſh, ſo far you feed, you nouriſh it; but would you feed a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſeaſe? If you feed your Corruption you ſtarve your ſouls; every degree of living, all acting after the fleſh, all complying therewith, ſtrengtheneth it, and weakneth your ſouls, do not you, O do not, ſtrengthen your enemy againſt your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſo much as you are led by the fleſh, and let it have its will, you honour it, you commend, you praiſe it, as if it were a good thing, a good Teacher, a good Maſter; but, will you honour ſuch a ſhameful thing? will you commend, will you praiſe, that God ſo much condemns, and abhorreth? you honouring it, diſhonour your ſelves, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, you ſhame your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To fulfill the deſires of the fleſh, is to ſpeak as if you were Debtors to it; as is intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the verſe before my Text, where we read thus,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97673:27"/>
                     <hi>Therefore brethren we are Debtors, not to the fleſh to live after the fleſh,</hi> No, how can we be Debtors to it, for it's a poor thing, it's not worth any thing, we never had or could have good by it, therefore we cannot be Debtors to it, except it ſhould be by Gods Command, or by compact and agreement or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but Gods command runs contrary, and as for agreement, we have covenanted with God, and promiſed oft to have nothing to do with the fleſh, therefore we are no way Debtors to it, unleſs it ſhall be ſaid, we owe it hatred, and all that we can do for it's deſtruction, ſo indeed we are Debtors to the fleſh, we owe it all poſſible hatred, and the utmoſt of our endeavour's for the utter extirpation and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining of it; whereas if we let the fleſh have its will, then we act as if we owed it ſervice, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to it by the bond of love. But this is ſure, you believers are exceedingly by all bonds, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations engaged in love, thankfulneſs, obedience, to the Father, and Son, and holy Spirit, who have made you, preſerved you, redeemed, called, and choſen you. So far as you ſerve the fleſh, you rob God, you do as pay money where you owe none, and refuſe or neglect to pay what you greatly ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for. Beſides, you believers have a principle of grace in you, to that you are Debtors, for it hath done you great good, by the new man created in you, your condition is altered, of Children of Satan, you are become Children of God, by it you are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for fellowſhip with God, by it you have had much peace, comfort, and God commands you to live after it, and have you not promiſed ſo to do? therefore ſpend not the money of your time, ſtrength, ſervice, in acting according to the Fleſh, to which you owe nothing, but pay your Debts to the new man, that ſeed of grace that is in you, quench al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the motions of the Fleſh, but blow up, nouriſh,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97673:28"/>cheriſh all holy motions, grieve the fleſh as much as ever you can, but pleaſe the ſpirit to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>To live after the fleſh is to countenance the old, and diſcountenance the new man; to give way at all to the fleſh, it is to favour, to ſmile upon your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and frown upon the ſeed of God in you.</p>
                  <p>Yea, it is to reſiſt the ſpirit, for that draws you from the fleſh; a contrary way to that wherein the fleſh would lead you;</p>
                  <p>Ag. To comply with the fleſh ſpeaks no, or little, love to Jeſus Chriſt, for the fleſh it was, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of man that murdered him, and it is againſt the death of Chriſt, for the Goſpel tells us Chriſt dyed, that we ſhould not live after the Fleſh, but to him that dyed for us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not hold you longer on this, only do you make good uſe of the Apoſtles argument, though you are ſure that you are in Chriſt, yet make uſe of this word, if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye; but remember to uſe it lawfully, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8. <hi>We know that the Law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully,</hi> ſo is this truth good, very good if it be uſed lawfully, not to hinder, but to help to a right grounded aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not to terrifie, but to awaken your ſpirits, not to overſes, but to ballaſt them, to poize them;—and this word is to be made uſe of ſeaſonably; There is a great deal of Chriſtian wiſdom in the ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble making uſe of truths; ſometimes your ſouls may be in a deſponding, fainting, ſinking frame, full of diſcouragement, and fear, then call to mind promiſes, gracious invitations, the comfortable words of Scripture; but too oft your ſpirits are in a light, vain temper, inclining to carnal confidence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, fearleſſeneſs, and careleſsneſs, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be ſomewhat bold, and ventrous upon evil; then is a fit ſeaſon to meditate on this truth, and to think, what do I do, why am I ſo heedleſs, what
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97673:28"/>mean I, to ſhew any friendſhip to, to hold corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with, or at all to countenance the fleſh, that Traytor, to the Majeſty of heaven, that dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy to my ſoul, doth not the Scripture ſay, if I, whatever I am, live after the fleſh, I ſhall dye?</p>
                  <p>O that the Lord would make uſe of this word (pray you, that he would) as he did of the Stone that <hi>David</hi> ſlung, whereby he killed that Gyant <hi>Goliah,</hi> our fleſh, corruption is as a mighty Gyant, he that ſpeaks the word, is of no ſtrength, but if God ſet in with it, it ſhall knock our fleſh on the head, and lay it dead, as that ſtone little <hi>David</hi> ſlung, run into the head of that Philiſtine, and brought him down dead to the Ground, ſo that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (whom he defyed) came, and ſtood upon him and cut off his head.</p>
                  <p>In a word, when ever the fleſh calls you after it, anſwer it with this, whenever Satan tempts you to follow it, let this be your reply, ſo and ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith.</p>
                  <p>And do you Parents Preach this to your Children, you friends and companions tell one another of this, when you ſee one another acting ſinfully, Children, Friends, Companions, the Lord God by his Apoſtle hath ſpoken it, If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, See what cauſe you have to bleſs the Lord, who once did live after the fleſh, but now do not, O mercy, rich mercy, that God hath turn'd you, from that way wherein had you ſtill lived, it would have carried you from God, from Heaven, into the bottomleſs pit, that place a thouſand times worſe, than <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s fiery Furnace when heated ſeventimes hotter than it uſed to be, while you live, praiſe God for this, that you live not after the fleſh.</p>

               <p>IN theſe words we have a Character and evident ſign of thoſe who ſhall live, with a promiſe of life to them; or this ſentence hath three things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A neceſſary, conſtant duty that is incumbent and lyes upon us all, that is to mortifie the deeds of the body. 2. The great means preſcribed for our doing this, and that's through the ſpirit. 3. The great advantage that cometh by ſo doing, and that's life, ye ſhall live. I intend to ſpeak to theſe three things, in three Doctrines diſtinctly, the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (the Doctrine now to be diſcuſſed) is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That it is a neceſſary and conſtant duty incumbent, or lying upon us all to mortifie (that is, to kill, ſlay and deſtroy) the deeds of the body.</p>
               <p>In the management of this truth, I am to ſhew, Firſt, What's meant by the body, and why it is ſo called. Secondly, what's meant by the deeds of the body, and why they are ſo named. Thirdly, what is it to mortifie the deeds thereof, and how is that to be done. Fourthly, why is this a neceſſary duty. Fifthly, why is it, a conſtant duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. What's meant by the body, and why is it ſo called?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Body here ſignifyeth (the ſame thing, with fleſh in the foregoing part of the Text) corrupt nature, or the corruption of nature, natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97673:29"/>that ſin we all brought into the world with us, in us, which is called, <hi>the body of the ſins of the fleſh,</hi> Col. 2.11. <hi>in whom alſo ye are circumciſed, with the circumciſion, made without hands, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the body of the ſins of the fleſh,</hi> and this is that which is tearmed <hi>the body of Sin,</hi> Rom. 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed,</hi> where by our old man, and the body of ſin, the ſame thing is underſtood, our old man (corrupt nature) is the body of ſin, it's altogether made up of ſin, it's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſin; this alſo is that the Apoſtle call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>the body of this death,</hi> Rom. 7.24 <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death,</hi> or (as it may be read) from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death.</p>
               <p>But why is the corruption of nature called the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? <hi>A.</hi> For the ſame reaſons, before given, why it's called the fleſh: and beſides thoſe, corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be called the body, for theſe reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The body hath many parts, and members, which being united make one body together, and each of thoſe members differ the one from the other in their proper nature and uſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4. <hi>We have many members in one body, and all members have not the ſame office,</hi> ſo is the myſtical body of Chriſt, his Church; and thus is it with the body of ſin, it hath divers parts and members, and therefore may be called in that place to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> even now cited, <hi>the body of the Sins of the fleſh;</hi> There is pride, hatred, hypocriſie, covetouſneſs, unbelief with many more, all which are as members of the body of ſin, there is a kind of union between them, they all together make one corrupt nature; and each of them differeth in the proper nature thereof, and in its working, or acting; as the hand is one
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97673:30"/>thing and acts in one manner, the foot another thing and acts in another manner, the eye differeth from the ear, and the ear from the eye; ſo is it with the ſeveral parts of corrupt nature.</p>
               <p>And it may be obſerved, as ſome parts of the body are inward, not ordinarily ſeen, or eaſie to be ſeen, others are outward, without, and manifeſt to all, ſo ſome luſts are more ſecret, and not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, or eaſily perceived, as others are, which daily ſhew themſelves; as alſo the being and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence or life of the body lyeth chiefly in thoſe parts that are within (as the Heart, Liver, Lungs which are more neceſſary to the body it's ſubſiſting, than the outward parts, as hands, legs) ſo the body of ſin hath its being principally in thoſe ſins that are more ſecret, leſs obvious, ſuch as hypocrifie, unbelief, formality, covetouſneſs, vanity of mind, theſe are as the Heart, Liver, and Lungs of the body of ſin, it would no longer ſubſiſt were there nothing of ſuch ſins within us, whereas the body of ſin may and oft doth continue, and that ſtrong, and luſty without ſome outward more manifeſt ſins, ſuch as Drunkenneſs, Adultery, Swearing, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Moreover a man hath all the members of his body from the womb, though he doth not uſe ſome of them ſo ſoon as others, the Child uſeth not its tongue, and legs ſo ſoon as its eyes and ears, though it be born with them all; ſo we bring all luſts into the world with us, though ſome ſhew themſelves and are exerted much ſooner than others, as pride, anger, lying; ſome Luſts in ſome men lye unacted long, and at laſt apppear, as ſome ſeed is much longer e're it come up than other, though ſown at the fame time, hence it's ſometimes ſaid, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch a man ſhould ſo fall, do ſuch an evil, I thought it had not been in him;</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97673:30"/>
               <p>And I may add as the Apoſtle <hi>ſaith, ſome members of the body are more,</hi> others leſs <hi>comely,</hi> and <hi>theſe we cover;</hi> ſo ſome members of the body of ſin, have a kind of comlineſs in the eye of men, others appear ſhameful to all, theſe men eſpecially hide, and cloak.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the body of every man is alike in the main, the body of one man hath the ſame parts that the body of another man hath, and there is a likeneſs between the ſeveral parts of the body of one and of another, yet ſo that there is ſome difference alſo, whereby one is known from another; The body of one is bigger, taller, ſtronger, fairer, than the body of another; ſome are of one Conſtitution and Complexion, ſome of another; thus is corrupt nature the body of ſin; in the main all bring into the world with them, the very ſame corruptions, luſts; therefore ſaith <hi>Solomon, as face anſwereth to face in water, ſo doth the heart of man to man,</hi> look what luſts and corruptions there are in one man's nature, there are ſuch in another's;</p>
               <p>Yet with ſome difference, the body of ſin in ſome is naturally (as I may ſay) bigger, ſtronger, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than it is in others, corruption vents it ſelf, and works (in one) differently from what it doth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſome it acts more covertly, cloſely, in others more obviouſly, openly, in ſome more ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pleaſingly, in others more roughly, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and to diſpleaſing;</p>
               <p>So that one man may as well think himſelf not to have ſuch a body as another man hath in the main, becauſe he is leſs, and more fair, as he may think himſelf not to have ſuch a corrupt nature, becauſe it doth not ſhew it ſelf ſo groſſly, evidently, or juſt in that way or manner, as in another.</p>
               <p>As one man excells in one member, and another
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97673:31"/>man excelleth in another member of his body, one hath better eyes, another better ears, another bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter legs, but ſtill they have the ſame kind of parts;</p>
               <p>So one man is more notable or notorious in one luſt, another in another luſt, one is famous (or rather infamous) for his pride, another for his diſſembling, a third for his covetouſneſs, but all have the ſame luſts by nature. You may ſay, ſome men never commit ſome ſins, ſome are never drunk, never commit fornication, therefore corrupt nature ſeems to have more members in one than in another, <hi>A.</hi> A man may have hands, and legs, or ears though he never uſe them, becauſe of ſome weakneſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, ſo ſome may not put forth this or that luſt, and yet have it in them, for it may be imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or hindred through their bodily conſtitution, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or ſome other cauſe, ſo that they don't exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, exert or ſhew it as others do. And though all men are not outwardly guilty of all kinds of ſin, yet there is hardly one ſin, but they are ſometime or other, leſs or more guilty of it inwardly (before Conſcience, though not before men) or before God, though Conſcience ſee it not at preſent, (for as the Apoſtle, <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>God is greater than Conſcience, and ſeeth all things,</hi> whereby he inſinuates, that Conſcience ſees not all) There is a committing Adultery with the heart, as well as with the body, as you know Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he that looks luſtfully, he hath committed Adultery already in his heart,</hi> there is alſo ſpiritual Adultery, ſpiritual Whoredom, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Drunkenneſs, ſpiritual Idolatry, of which all are too guilty one way or other before God (happy he, who is duely ſenſible thereof.) Yet perhaps as ſome have monſtrous bodies, ſuch as are not uſual, they have ſome parts extraordinary, ſome have ſix Toes, ſix fingers, inſtead of five, ſo the body of ſin
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97673:31"/>may be in ſome as a monſter, in reſpect of ſomething extraordinary that is to be found in it, or becauſe of ſomething unuſual it moveth, and cauſeth (thoſe in whom it is) to do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Corruption of nature acts in and through the whole body of man, in all the members and parts thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. <hi>I ſpeak after the manner of men, becauſe of the infirmity of your fleſh, for as ye have yielded your members</hi> (not this or that member, but your members) <hi>ſervants to uncleanneſs, and to iniquity, unto iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. Corruption iſſueth forth through the eyes, hence we read <hi>of the luſt of the eyes,</hi> and <hi>Job made a covenant with his eyes;</hi> through the ears, hence the Scripture ſpeaks <hi>of itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ears,</hi> deaf, heavy ears, ſtop'd with ſin; through or by the feet, hence we have mention made of <hi>feet ſwift to evil,</hi> and of the <hi>foot of pride;</hi> through or by the tongue, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, the tongue is a world of evil, ſet on fire of hell,</hi> and the Scripture telleth us of <hi>a lying tongue, a falſe tongue,</hi> and a tongue that hath as <hi>the gall of Aſps under it,</hi> ſo as to all other parts of the body, ſin within ſets all on work, and that not only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but the inward parts alſo, it ſtirs a mans blood, moveth his heart, it opens and ſhuts, it empties and fills the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Corruption of nature chiefly acts in every one according to the temperament, or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of his body, if a man be of a ſanguine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, his corruption works ſutably to that, as is obſerv'd in <hi>David</hi> who was of a ruddy countenance, or if a man be of a cholerick, melancholy, or phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick temper, accordingly natural ſin doth diſcover it ſelf, and it's fruits are anſwerable;</p>
               <p>Fifthly, As the body and ſoul of man are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo corruption and man's ſoul, though it be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97673:32"/>natural, yet it may be ſeparated from the ſoul, and the ſoul may be quite rid of its ſin, as of its body, corrupt nature may be killed as the body, and ſo the ſoul releaſed from it, though not ſo eaſily; an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter is it, to kill the body wherein the ſoul dwells, not ſo, to kill that ſin that naturally dwells in the ſoul; yet both are alike eaſie to God, it is as facile or eaſie to him to deſtroy our body which we have as ſinners, as it is for him to kill our body which we have as men, he can run it through and pierce the very heart of the body of ſin in us, by the ſword of his ſpirit much more eaſily, than <hi>Goliah,</hi> had he been near <hi>David,</hi> could have run him through with his Sword.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, As the body doth nothing, acts not, moves not without the ſoul, and if the ſoul be once gone, it's dead without any motion, or ability to move; ſo corrupt nature acts not without our ſoul, it works by the underſtanding, by the will, by this and that affection; had not a man an Immortal ſoul, he would have no corruption, as beaſts have none; and let the heart be once taken off from ſin, then corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dyeth, and when the heart ſhall be perfectly ſeparated from it, then corrupt nature will be quite dead, and we ſhall be perfectly freed from it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, As the body is ſtill breeding filth, flegm, choler, and divers excrements, hair, nails and that which is not handſom plainly to mention, but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>it goes to the draught,</hi> ſo the body of ſin is ſtill breeding that which is filth in the ſight of God and the eye of an enlightned Conſcience, it's ſtill ſending forth divers excrements, whereto the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> may have reſpect when he ſaith, <hi>lay aſide all filthineſs, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, As there is a natural inclination in the body to generation, to the propagation of its kind, ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97673:32"/>in the body of ſin to beget its like; hence the Devil (who hath, though no viſible body, yet a body of ſin) tempted our great Grand-mother, or firſt Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> and (as I may ſo ſay) begat the body of ſin in her, he knew her in a ſpiritual ſenſe, e're <hi>Adam</hi> knew her in a natural way, and then by <hi>Eves</hi> help, he knew <hi>Adam</hi> and begat the body of ſin in him; and all ſinners under the power of ſin, ſeek to make others like themſelves, <hi>they compaſs,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Sea and Land to make a proſelyte,</hi> Mat. 23.15. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye compaſs Sea and Land to make one proſelyte, and when he is made, ye make him two fold more the Child of hell than your ſelves</hi> (where Chriſt ſpeaks of an Apoſtate; or Chriſt ſpeaks of one who having been openly profane, and groſſly wicked outwardly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a cloſe Phariſaical Hypocrite. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>he was before a blaſphemer,</hi> and what did he do, when he was a blaſphemer? Acts 26.11. <hi>he compelled others to blaſpheme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9ly. There is ſuch an union between the ſoul and body while together, that the ſoul no where, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acts without it, the ſoul acts much according as it is with the body, whether it be ſick or well, weak or ſtrong; and the ſoul is much hindred in acting according to its own proper nature as a ſpirit, by the body, ſo while corruption is in the ſoul, the ſoul acts not without it, all the actings of the ſoul have a tincture and defilement more or leſs from it, according to the ſtrength or weakneſs of corruption, ſo the ſoul acts leſs or more ſinfully, and it is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily hindered in acting according to its own nature as a ſpirit thereby. But not to carry this too far.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, As the body is ſtill craving one thing or other, meat, drink, ſleep, cloaths, the cool ſhade, or warm fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So corrupt nature is ſtill craving,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97673:33"/>now to have this, and then to have that iuſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, this or that motion fulfilled. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, the <hi>eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the ear with hearing,</hi> ſo corrupt nature is never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſinning, but as, the more, many times, a man ſees and hears of that which delights, the more he deſires to ſee, and to hear, ſo the more corrupt nature in its luſtings is anſwered, the more doth it call, the more doth it luſt, it's like the Horſe-Leech, that ſtill crieth <hi>give, give,</hi> and like the fire and thoſe other things which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>never ſay it is enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. What are we to underſtand by the deeds of the body?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The deeds of the body of ſin muſt needs be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deeds, what are the deeds of your natural body as men? they are natural deeds, ſuitable to it, ſuch as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſpeaking, laughing, weeping, going, running and the reſt: So what are the deeds of the body of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? they are deeds agreeable to it, corrupt deeds, ſuch as coveting, lying, boaſting, vain glorying, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, diſſembling, with thoſe many other of that evil kind, that curſed generation.</p>
               <p>The deeds of the body, are the fruits and births of it, which are ſometimes called <hi>the works of the fleſh,</hi> as in that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. ſometimes, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the fleſh, or our members which are upon the earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſneſs which is Idolatry,</hi> theſe are the deeds of the body, or the deeds of the old man, as it's expreſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. <hi>lye not one to another, ſeeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</hi> In other places theſe deeds, are called the deſires, or wills, and motions of the fleſh, in thoſe places formerly cited.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:97673:33"/>
               <p>It is to be noted well, that the Apoſtle calls all the outgoings and movings of corruption, deeds and works, though they break not forth into outward actions;</p>
               <p>If ſome were bid or exhorted to repent of their wicked deeds and evil works, they would be ready to ſay, what? what evil deeds, what wicked works, have I done, or do I? becauſe, it may be, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be charged with any great matter by man.</p>
               <p>But conſider, look inward, have you not had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny luſtings, many motions of corruption, this way, and that, many evil affections ſtirring? theſe are deeds and works before God, they have as real evil, and offenſiveneſs in them in Gods eye, as any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, and therefore ought not to be made light, but our hearts ſhould mourn, be aſhamed, humbled, and broken for them, as well as for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſins.</p>
               <p>Some one may here ask, why ſaith our Apoſtle, if ye mortifie the deeds of the body, why ſaith he not, if ye mortifie the body? it may be thought he ſhould rather have ſpoke of mortifying the body of corruption it ſelf, than the deeds of it,</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. The Apoſtle may thus expreſs himſelf, becauſe the deeds of corrupt nature are thoſe we are ſenſible of, we are not ſenſible of the body of ſin it ſelf directly, but by ſome or other of its deeds, but for its luſtings, affections, and motions we ſhould not know it to be in us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the way to mortifie the body of ſin it ſelf, is to mortifie its deeds, we cannot come at it to give it a blow, but in its affections, and motions, and ſo far as the deeds of the body of ſin are morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſo far is it mortified. As break a mans head to pieces, or ſtop his breathing, and you kill his body.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:97673:34"/>
               <p>If any ſay, rather the way to mortifie the deeds of the body is to mortifie the body it ſelf, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the root is the beſt way to mortifie the fruit, then I anſwer, the Apoſtle intends that, that we morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the deeds of the body, by mortifying the body, corrupt nature it ſelf which muſt be done, for if any could mortifie the deeds of the old man barely, the body of ſin ſtill remaining unſubdued, that would not avail.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is by the mortification of the deeds of the body, that we know whether it be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, yea or no, as by the movings of the natural body, by the eyes, hands, and noſtrils we know a man's body to be alive or dead.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtle may hereby teach us we muſt fight againſt the body of ſin in a particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct way, taking our aim now at this, and then at that member of it, working and motion of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its ſtirring in us. Or perhaps the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle might chooſe to ſay the deeds of the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the body of ſin it ſelf will ſtill abide in a great meaſure all our dayes here, but divers of the deeds of it may be even wholly mortifyed in this life, and particular motions, they may be quite mortified, the moving of this and that luſt, at this and that time may be quite deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 3. What is it to mortifie, kill and deſtroy the deeds of the body, and how is that to be done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No one of us but hath a body of ſin in him, as really as every one hath a body of fleſh viſible, wherein his ſoul dwelleth, ſo really hath every one an inviſible body of ſin dwelling in his ſoul, which body of ſin hath had many deeds, luſtings, evil motions, in time paſt; and it hath many ſtill, and ſo ſtill will it have while we are here, for it is even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ontinually luſting, ſtirring one way or other. I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97673:34"/>ſhall therefore, 1. ſpeak ſomewhat concerning the mortifying the deeds of the body paſt. 2. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mortifying of the deeds of the body of ſin, as to time preſent. 3. Concerning the mortifying thereof, with reſpect to time to come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the deeds of the body of ſin paſt, thoſe luſtings, thoſe evil affections, ſinful motions, that heretofore you have had, they in a ſenſe are to be mortifyed. How is that to be done? How ſhall they that are paſt be deſtroyed. <hi>Anſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By a hearty confeſſion before God, with Godly ſorrow, and faith acted in Prayer, on the Word of God, and blood of Chriſt, for the pardon of them through his grace.</p>
               <p>This is the way to mortifie any, and all the deeds of the body, that have been found with you in times paſt, you muſt get them forgiven, and then they will be mortified, they are as dead in Law, they are as if they had never been, they will not, and cannot be charged upon you. When a ſuit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, a charge brought againſt any, and it's diſcharged, no more to be medled with, it is then mortifyed in Law; ſo when your ſins are pardoned to you by God, they are then buried, they are blotted out, they are caſt into the depths of the ſea. Therefore, the way to get what's paſt mortifyed, is to get it remitted, taken off the file, to ſeek to have the book of Divine Juſtice croſs't, where your debts and offences ſtand as fair written, till forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And the way for that is, heartily to confeſs (ſo far as you may) before God, all the former ſtirrings and workings of your corruption, which have been in you, and which have ſhewn themſelves in your converſations; if we confeſs, God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, but then our confeſſion, muſt be with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, brokenneſs of heart, and humiliation; and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97673:35"/>we muſt act faith on the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the promiſes of the Covenant, we muſt alſo beg the remiſſion of our paſt ſins through the grace of God in Chriſt. Do this in truth, ſo will all the deeds of your corrupt nature be done away by the hand of pardoning grace, and ſo will they be mortifyed, as Debts are, when the Debtor is acquitted. Which though it be not directly intended in my Text, yet is it implyed, for without this, the deeds of the fleſh preſent or to come will never be truely mortifyed; None have any corruption indeed ſubdued, unleſs they are pardoned and juſtified. Mortification of ſin, is included in ſanctification, and ſanctification, is never without juſtification.</p>
               <p>Nor ever did, will, or can any ſet upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the deeds of the fleſh preſent and to come, unleſs they confeſs, and mourn for what's paſt, and ſue out a pardon according to the Goſpel. Therefore look to this, that you ſeek to have what's paſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, ſo as hath been expreſs'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the mortifying the deeds of the body as to time preſent.</p>
               <p>This muſt be, or nothing will be done with reſpect to time to come. There muſt be a beginning, and ſetting upon the laying dead, preſent ſinful motions.</p>
               <p>If ye mortifie (ſaith my Text) it ſpeaks in the preſent tenſe, If ye now ſtir up your ſelves in this work;</p>
               <p>What is this to mortifie the deeds of the body, preſent? <hi>A.</hi> It is to put a ſtop to the movings of ſin, ſo that they may ceaſe, as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.15. <hi>If I ſay, I will ſpeak thus,</hi> (that is ſinfully as before in the foregoing words) <hi>behold, I ſhould offend against the generation of thy children;</hi> He found envy becauſe of the proſperity of the wicked ſtirring in him, and diſcontent, becauſe of his own affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97673:35"/>condition; whereupon he ſet himſelf to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe luſts in the preſent motions thereof, and he did ſo, he ſtopt their mouth. So when unbelief moved in him, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 77. and cauſed him to begin to ſay, <hi>will the Lord be favourable no more, hath he forgotten to be gracious?</hi> he tells us he ſaid this is my infirmity, v. 10. thus he put a bar againſt the working of his unbelief, ſo we ſhould ſtill mortifie every luſting, and motion of ſin, as men mortifie a ſore, or diſeaſe, by uſing all means, to put a ſtop to it, that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and ſpread not. We ſhould not reſt till cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption be ſilenced, and give over its ſollicitations, and if it will be ſtirring ſtill, we ſhould labour to weaken the ſtrength of it as much as poſſible; ſo far as it's weakned, it's mortified, as the weaker our body groweth, the nearer it is to death, there is a degree of death in weakneſs.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we thus mortifie the preſent deeds of the fleſh? <hi>A.</hi> In a few particulars at this time.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Keep an obſerving eye upon the body of ſin, mind carefully, obſerve diligently, what deeds it brings forth, what motions it hath at this and that time; as in ſight, they eye and mark every motion of the enemy. There are who though they have many and mighty workings of corruption, they are ignorant of them, or they little regard them, except in ſome more than ordinary caſe, but foraſmuch as we have a body of ſin that is very fruitful, we ſhould ſtill take good notice what fruit it doth yield, which way it moveth.</p>
               <p>How ſhall we mortifie the things we are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with? How oft is it, that the body of ſin works covetouſly? How oft that it moves proudly? How frequent that it luſteth enviouſly in this or that man? and he is not apprehenſive, or ſenſible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and then how is he like to do any thing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97673:36"/>towards the killing its fruits, to bar its out-goings?</p>
               <p>Secondly, When you perceive any riſing or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of corruption, it's good to conſider what it is that giveth occaſion thereto, or by what it is that it takes occaſion, whether it be ſome object of ſenſe, ſomething you ſee, or hear, or feel, or ſomething that you think of; whenever luſt ſtirrs, there is ſomething which adminiſtreth occaſion to it, or whereby it takes occaſion, what that is, muſt be noted, and being known it muſt be avoided; If it be your looking on any thing, you muſt turn away your eye, if it be your hearing any thing, you muſt ſtop your ear thereto, as ſoon as may be, except it be ſuch a thing as you are bound in duty to hear, for ſin takes occaſion ſometimes by that which is good, even by the Word of God it ſelf, as the Apoſtle faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Sin took occaſion in him by the Commandment,</hi> ſin took occaſion in thoſe that heard <hi>Stephen</hi> Preach (though he ſpake in the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>to fill them with madneſs</hi> and cauſe them to ſtone him, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.54. <hi>When they heard theſe things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnaſhed on him with their teeth.</hi> Sin took occaſion oft in thoſe that heard Chriſt to work the more enviouſly and maliciouſly againſt him; therefore I ſay, when any thing you hear ſtirrs your corruption, turn away your ear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be that which you ought to give ear to, and if it be any thing you are thinking of, that kindles any luſt in you, by all means divert your thoughts to ſomething elſe. (except alſo it be a thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is your duty to meditate, and then other means is to be uſed, or an other time more fit is to be taken for thoſe thoughts) The ſame may be ſaid of place, and company or any thing elſe, which awakens your ſin, and calls it forth, put it away ſpeedily, or turn from it, take away the fuel that the fire may go out;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97673:36"/>as Chriſt ſaith, cut off your right hand, your right foot, pluck out your right eye, if it offend you, if it cauſe you to offend, if it draw out your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, divorce your ſelves, be ſequeſtred from it, whatever it be, how dear, or near ſoever it be to you; and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>look away from the wine, when it's red in the cup,</hi> when thou beginneſt to be ſo pleaſed with it, as to have thy appetite too much raiſed and ſet on edge by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When corruption any way acts in you, then ſhould you call to mind ſomething of the Word of God, which is moſt proper and fit, ſomething that the Scripture ſpeaks againſt it, or concerning the evil of it, or that which will follow upon it, if you give way thereto. This hath been, and will be found a very notable help in mortifying any preſent motion of ſin, a ſeaſonable remembrance of ſome ſuitable Scripture, hence ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Moreover brethren, I would not have you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> &amp;c. v. 6. <hi>theſe things were our examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo lasted,</hi> &amp;c. and oft when he ſpeaks againſt any ſin, he minds them of ſome Scripture ſaying, <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have,</hi> (Heb. 13.5.6. <hi>for he hath ſaid I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee, ſo that we may boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me.</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves, rather give place unto wrath, for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vengeance is mine, and I will repay, ſaith the Lord,</hi> by which and other like places we are taught this, when we feel this or that luſt moving in us, to call to mind, and give our ſelves ſeriouſly to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on ſome Scripture that hath an aptneſs for the quelling of it.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:97673:37"/>
               <p>Fourthly, At all times when any evil affection breaks out, or luſt bubles up, thoughts concerning God are a great help to the ſubduing thereof, if they are with ſeriouſneſs. It may be when <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs tempted him, he might at firſt find ſome ſtirring in himſelf not good, but he mortified it, by remembring God, for firſt he thought of God, e're he ſaid, <hi>how ſhall I do this, and ſin against God.</hi> God ſaith of thoſe who are carried away by their luſts they have forgotten him, becauſe the living, and prevailing of their ſin ariſeth from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.25. <hi>This is thy lot, the portion of thy meaſures from me, ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou hast forgotten me, and truſted in falſhood;</hi> how came they to truſt in falſhood, becauſe they remembered not God and his faithfulneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Becauſe my people have forgotten me, they have burnt incenſe to vanity, and they have cauſed them to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their wayes from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not caſt up, to make their Land deſolate, a perpetual hiſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoughts concerning Gods Majeſty, loftineſs, Almightineſs, jealouſie, omnipreſence, or his filling Heaven and Earth, all places with his preſence, his all ſeeing eye, his holineſs and other his properties and attributes are an excellent means to curb a luſt, and give it a deadly wound, to quench the fiery motions of ſin as with water. Find me a place ſaid one when tempted where God ſees not, or is not, then will I yeild. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Grudge not one againſt another brethren, leſt ye be condemned,</hi> but how ſhall we ſtop our hearts when they begin to grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a brother, it follows, <hi>behold the Judge ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the door,</hi> as if he had ſaid, remember, the holy juſt Lord is near, he ſeeth, he heareth, he ſtands at the door of your heart, and looks in, for its
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97673:37"/>alwayes wide open to him, and he will judge righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement, e're you are aware he'l be upon you, even now already he is at the door.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, You ſhould go to God, if it may be, eſpecially if corruption ſtir very much, then it's exceeding good ſpeedily to get alone, and fall down before the Lord, and ſpread thy heart before him, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did <hi>Rabſhekahs</hi> railing letter, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſay, behold Lord, ſee in mercy and pity to me, ſee what a heart I have, how it needs thy grace, ſee how my corrupt nature works; and ſo cry out for help as <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſurrounded him, thinking it had been <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.31. Jehoſaphat <hi>cryed out and the Lord helped him, and God moved them to depart from him;</hi> when we cannot get alone, and in all ordinary caſes, it's good to lift up the heart to God, with an inward ſigh and groan, heart ſighs and groans have very much in them to mortifie a ſtirring, lively luſt, when the ſoul ſighs inwardly, O wretched man that I am, that ſin thus remains, thus works in me, Lord deliver me. Some ſay every ſigh fetcheth a drop of blood from the heart, I may ſay every hearty ſigh fetcheth a drop of blood from the heart of ſin, if it be for ſin, but we muſt not only ſigh becauſe of the preſent working of corruption, and ask the death of that, but alſo ſigh becauſe of the ſpring whence the evil ſtream flows, and beg the drying up of that, the pulling up the root, and killing it, as well and more, than the deſtruction of the fruit.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Ever have this ſetled in thine heart, as a ſure truth, when any ſin ſtirs in thee, and luſt flames, or burns, it is better to think thy ſelf more guilty of it at that time than thou art, rather than leſs, to think thy ſelf more guilty will hardly hurt thee, but to think thy ſelf leſs guilty will harden
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97673:38"/>thee, and make thee leſs active againſt thy ſin. Yea, I ſhould adviſe thee, that thou would'ſt look upon thy ſelf as more guilty than thou ſeemeſt to thy ſelf to be, at that time when thou art under the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this or that luſt, for it's ſeldom or never, but a man under the ſtrong motions of corruption, ſeems to himſelf leſs guilty than he is, becauſe ſin when working (eſpecially) blinds a man's mind, puts out his eyes, or caſts a miſt before them, hence, if pride act outwardly in a man, others ſee it more than he himſelf, ſo a man's covetouſneſs (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) appears more to others (if it vent it ſelf) than to himſelf, ſo a man's anger, wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As oft when men are drunk, or far gone in drink, they perceive it not, or nothing ſo much as others, who are ſober, and look on them; a man in drink thinks himſelf ſometimes, then beſt and moſt himſelf, when his wits are juſt upon being drowned. So is it with a man when he is as drunk with any luſt; therefore ſtill think in thy ſelf when any luſt is up in thee, that thou art more guilty than thou appeareſt to thy ſelf, or fear it at leaſt, that thy corruption works more ſtrongly than thou art ſenſible of; this will further its mortification, by ſtirring thee up the more againſt it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, When ſin kindles, or is ſtirred up in you, it's good to remember what thoughts you have had thereof formerly, when alone, and moſt ſerious, and neareſt to God, humbling your ſelves before him, for uſually our thoughts of ſin differ much, when we are under its preſent working, actually now captivated by it, from what they are of it, at ſuch times, when we are ſerious, when near God, when humbling our ſelves in his ſight, therefore we ſhould endeavour to keep the thoughts, then we have of our ſin, freſh in our minds, and to recall them when ſin renews its aſſaults.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:97673:38"/>
               <p>It's good alſo to remember, the former ill fruit, and ſad effect of ſuch a ſin as now works, when heretofore it hath got the upper hand of us: as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of God's goodneſs, mercy, faithfulneſs and power works hope, ſo experience, if well thought of and conſidered, of the miſchievouſneſs, folly, and hurtfulneſs of ſin in its former iſſuings forth, worketh ſhame, fear, hatred, whereby the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof, tends much to the mortification of it, in its preſent acting.</p>
               <p>Father, it is very uſeful to think, how ſuch a ſin which at this or that time you feel riſing, ſtirring in you, hath look'd in your eye, when you have ſeen it breaking forth in another, how have you then diſlik'd it? what thoughts have you had of it? how have you ſpoken againſt it? yea, perhaps I may ſay, what indignation did you ſhew againſt it, at ſuch and ſuch a time? remember theſe things; for though ſin be the ſame, of the ſame nature in all, we naturally are prone to conceit otherwiſe, and to imagine ſuch a ſin in our ſelves, is not ſo bad as it appears to us when we ſee it in another.</p>
               <p>Moreover, your former purpoſes, promiſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions againſt your ſin ſhould not be forgotten, but be duely weighed. But, not to add more.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Have this perſwaſion fixed firmly, and deeply rooted in your hearts, the ſooner you ſtep back in an evil way, the better, and that it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great danger to go forward therein; when corruption is up, and we are in the hands of a luſt, thoughts many times come in from Satan and Sin, as if we had as good go forward, as there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, over ſhoes, over boots, being gone ſo far as good venter further, it's all one, at leaſt we may take ſome ſteps more in that dirty path, but this thought is very naught, exceeding evil, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97673:39"/>ſin. Shall a man think becauſe I have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, i'le throw my ſelf down, becauſe I have ſlip'd poyſon, I'le drink a full draught, or I'le ſip yet again, becauſe I am fallen into the water, I had as good go in over head and ears, becauſe I have run ſomewhat in debt, I'le run more, and more? <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. <hi>the beginning of ſtrife, is as when a man letteth out water, therefore leave off contention before it be medled with;</hi> thus it is as to any ſin, it's as the letting out of water, which the ſooner it's ſtop'd the better, for if it begin to break thorow the bank, you know nor when it will be turn'd back, and the longer it hath its courſe through this or that place, the harder it is to turn it, and the wider the breach will be. Therefore ever think it's beſt to leave off ſin quickly, the ſooner, the better, That alſo which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the lips of a fool is true of every luſt, if not timely ſtop'd, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.12, 13. <hi>the Lips of a fool will ſwallow up himſelf, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words of his mouth is fooliſhneſs, and the end of his talk is miſchievous madneſs.</hi> And that of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> may be remembred, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. therefore have this alwayes in thy heart as a rule of wiſdom, ſtep back ſpeedily in a bad way. <hi>Solomon</hi> (you may remember) brings in the ſluggard ſaying, <hi>a little more ſteep, a little more ſlumber, a little more folding of the hands to ſleep;</hi> to whom he giveth this anſwer, <hi>ſo ſhall thy poverty come as an armed man,</hi> &amp;c. So, when thou ſayeſt of any ſin, a little more, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more, a few ſteps more, one ſtep, and another ſtep more, thus will thy miſery, thy ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row come as an armed man unavoidably. We alſo read, he that loveth his Son chaſteneth him betimes, ſo, be that loveth his ſoul, and hateth his ſin, will make head againſt it, and ſeek it's 'ruine betimes. It's eaſier to kill a thing that's young, as a young
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97673:39"/>Serpent, a young Lyon, than one that's grown and great.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the deeds of the fleſh, the affections, or motions of the body of ſin with reſpect to time to come.</p>
               <p>To mortifie theſe is to prevent them wholly ſo far as we can, and to endeavour that thoſe which will be, may be as few, and as weak as poſſible, for which purpoſe, I ſhall at this time give you only ſix or ſeven ſhort rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Fear thy ſelf, fear leaſt this, and that luſt or corruption break forth in thee, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Bleſſed is the man, that feareth alway, but he that hardneth his heart, ſhall fall into evil.</hi> That is, bleſſed is he that feareth himſelf alway, that fears leaſt he be overtaken with evil, carried away by ſin, why is that man bleſſed? <hi>A.</hi> becauſe he doth not harden his heart, and ſo ſhall not fall into miſchief, as the following words teach; but he that harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his heart ſhall fall into miſchief; he that feareth alwayes is not ſelf confident, but watchful, and wary, circumſpect, and careful, and ſo he will be kept from thoſe tranſgreſſions others fall into, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is truely wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.16. <hi>A wiſe man feareth, and departeth from evil;</hi> the Scripture knows and owns no other as a wiſe man, but ſuch a one, who fears himſelf leſt he ſin, and feareth God, ſo as to watch againſt ſin.</p>
               <p>Wherefore fear thou, do ſo, as to former ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities which have prevailed in thee; conſider how often thou haſt offended ſo and ſo, conſider how ſubject thou art in thy ſelf to tranſgreſs, conſider how watchful Satan is to cauſe thee to tranſgreſs, ſo fear leſt, as it hath been, it be again. Yea, fear thy ſelf as to thoſe evils which hitherto thou haſt ſeldom or not at all been overtaken with; Though
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97673:40"/>thou beeſt as good a Diſciple as <hi>Peter</hi> thou ſhould'ſt fear leſt ſome time or other thou deny thy Lord and Maſter; though thou be as Patient as <hi>Job,</hi> thou ſhould'ſt fear leſt under ſome notable tryal that may come, thou ſhew great impatience: though thou art as meek as <hi>Moſes,</hi> thou ſhould'ſt fear, left thou be overtaken with unadviſedneſs, and ſinful anger; though thou art or wert as Righteous as <hi>Lot,</hi> as holy as <hi>David,</hi> thou ſhould'ſt fear, leſt thou be capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by ſuch corruptions as they were; though thou wert as ſtrong in faith as <hi>Abraham,</hi> thou would'ſt have reaſon to fear the prevailing of unbelief; and no doubt one great end, why the miſcarriages of thoſe and other good men are recorded, is to keep all, even the beſt, fearful of themſelves, watchful and careful, while they live in this evil world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Store your minds with the principal Scriptures againſt the ſeveral deeds of the fleſh, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. <hi>is not my word, like the fire, (ſaith the Lord) and like the hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?</hi> Yes, God's Word, is like the fire, and like the hammer, that breaketh the rock in pieces; ſo thou ſhalt find it to be to thy corruptions if thou make a right uſe thereof; chiefly ſhould you trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up in your hearts Scriptures relating to thoſe ſins, whereto you are more eſpecially inclined, either by conſtitution, calling, education, cuſtom, or ſome temptation.</p>
               <p>Whatever thou readeſt, or heareſt againſt any ſuch deed of the fleſh, lay it up, take it home to thy ſelf, and apply it to thine own ſin, principally la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to retain, and oft think of that which at any time thou haſt found, or findeſt moſt to work upon thee, for one word, worketh moſt upon one tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, another word, upon another temper moſt, and that which hath at any time done you good,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97673:40"/>or affected you, is more likely to prevail with you, and keep you from ſuch a ſin for time to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Seek to the Lord to help thee, not only as to the preſent, but with reſpect to hereafter, and ſeek earneſtly, ſeek as for thy life, as thou would'ſt beg to be kept from Thieves, and Robbers, and Murderers, lying in wait for thee. Be ſure alſo to truſt in God for his preſervation, his keeping thee from all evil deeds, as thou would'ſt truſt in the Lord to be kept from the arrows of the Peſtilence, in a very hot time of the ſickneſs, or from a great ſtorm, in the mid'ſt of the rocks; but let your truſt in God be upon the account of his Word, ſuch and ſuch promiſes as he hath made for the keeping his people, and the ſubduing their iniquities. As <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi> exhorted the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.20. Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat <hi>ſtood, and ſaid, Hear me, O</hi> Judah, <hi>and ye Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed, believe his Prophets</hi> (that is believe in him becauſe of his Word ſpoken by his Prophets) <hi>ſo ſhall ye proſper;</hi> thus do ye, O Chriſtians, ſo ſhall ye proſper in this bleſſed work of mortifying your ſins.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When thou ſeeſt any one fall into ſin, bleſs not thy ſelf, as if thou wert in thy ſelf better than he, nor deſpiſe him, nor revile him, theſe things are themſelves from the fleſh, fruits of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and they will harden thee, and they will provoke the Lord to leave thee to the like or worſe. Above all, take heed that thy heart be never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly glad of another's falling, as ſometimes the heart of ſome is, either becauſe they deſire their ſhame, whom they ſee to ſin, or becauſe they think themſelves commended by the fall of others. But let us ever remember when we ſee others ſin, to bleſs God, God who keeps us from doing the ſame
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97673:41"/>things, and let's pity thoſe who ſin, as we pity ſuch who are carried captive by ſome cruel enemy, or ſuch who are beſides themſelves, and therefore hurt, and wound themſelves; Let's alſo pray much for thoſe that ſin, and let's by the ſin of others take occaſion to humble our ſelves for the corruption of our nature; as that good man, who ſaw no man ſo bad, but he would ſay ſuch a one am I, as bad by nature. And as that father who ſeeing one fall, would ſay, he to day, and I to morrow.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Conſider well before hand what temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations you are like to meet with for the ſtirring up any ſin in you, and do what you may to prevent them. As whatever may cauſe any ſickneſs in your bodies, ſo far as you can, and know it, you by all means avoid it, lo, and much more (if more can be) you ſhould avoid whatever may excite or draw forth any luſt in you. When a man takes no care of himſelf, but heats, and cools, eats any thing, drinks unſeaſonably, as when he's very hot, throws off his cloaths without any regard to the ſeaſon, or the like; will you wonder if he be ſick? ſo when a man takes no care of his ſoul, when he goes into and continues in any Company, runs himſelf without heed into any Company, upon occaſions of ſin, needleſſly doing things which ſtir up corruption; No wonder if he abound in deeds of the body.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, When thou goeſt about any work, into any Company, uſe thy ſelf to think what ſin thou art moſt like to be tempted to, where Satan is moſt like to get in, or on what he moſt probably will take hold, and fore-arm thy ſelf, by ſome ſutable thoughts, and ſerious arguments, particularly praying againſt that ſin thou art like to be drawn to, or to have ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in thee.</p>
               <p>And be ſure to be alwayes well employed, about ſome lawful profitable thing, either advantagious
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97673:41"/>to thy ſelf or others, diligence in good, is a good help to mortifie ſin,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Look upon the greateſt friends of thy ſin as the worſt enemies of thy ſoul, which it's ſure they are, for Satan is the greateſt friend of thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the worſt enemy of thy ſoul; ever alſo look on the greateſt enemies of thy ſin, as the beſt friends of thy ſoul, as thou haſt reaſon, for God and Chriſt are the greateſt enemies of all to thy ſin, and they are the beſt friends of all to thy ſoul, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more any one is a friend to thy ſin, the worſe enemy he is to thy ſoul, and the more any one is an enemy to thy ſin, the better friend he is to thy ſoul; do thou ſo account, be ſo perſwaded, this will help to the mortifying thy ſin, for it will keep thine ear open to reproof, and make way, for the ſinking of wholſom words into thine heart, whereas if thou thinkeſt, he that hates thy ſin, hates thee (which is too ordinary) and he that flatters and humors thee in thy evil affections and ſo is a friend to them, loves thee, this will keep thy ſin alive, and nouriſh it greatly, for it will cauſe thee to give ear to thoſe things that will feed thy corruption. Much more might have been ſaid, and more may be ſpoken afterward, let thus much ſuffice at preſent.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 4. WHy is it a neceſſary duty to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the deeds of the body?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is moſt manifeſt that this is a neceſſary duty, that there is an Abſolute neceſſity lying upon us all, and upon me, and thee, every one of you; not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97673:42"/>only becauſe it is commanded, but it is neceſſary in it ſelf, and for our own good; It is neceſſary that we may eſcape death, for if we do not mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, we ſhall live after the fleſh, and ſo dye at laſt. They ſay a Crocodile and a man ſeldom meet, but one of them dyeth for it, if the man kill not the Crocodile, the Crocodile will kill the man, This is true of every deed of the body of ſin, either a man muſt kill it, or he will be killed by it, kill, or be killed, is moſt true as to all ſin. The words I am upon, teach, this is neceſſary to life, and that muſt be, if it be neceſſary to the eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death.</p>
               <p>But to evince this by ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Is it not neceſſary that a deadly diſeaſe be mortified? you know it is, it will mortifie if it be not mortified, but ſin is the diſeaſe of the ſoul, and it's deadly, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>when it's finiſhed it brings forth death,</hi> and as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>it brings forth fruit unto death.</hi> No di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe whatever more deadly to the body, than every unmortified deed of the fleſh is to the ſoul; a bodily diſeaſe hurts not the ſoul, but an unmortified luſt hurts ſoul and body with the greateſt hurt, is it not neceſſary then to be mortified? or is it not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that a mettal enemy that's near a man be ſlain if poſſible, there being no other way to avoid death by his hands, but to lay him dead at ones feet? much more is it neceſſary to deſtroy our ſins, there being no other way to eſcape death by them, or no way effectual without this, and no enemy hurtful as our luſts unſubdued are. It is indeed only ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified that can do us any hurt, real, or abiding hurt, the world could not miſchief us, Satan could not prejudice us, were all our luſts laid dead, as they ſhould be; therefore well ſaid one of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97673:42"/>in a letter to his Wife, be alwayes an enemy to the world, and to the Devil, but eſpecially, to your own fleſh, your own corruption. But we lye open to the malice of all enemies, if any ſin be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to live in us; a luſt unmortified is as an open door to let Satan into our ſouls, it gives him hold of us, it is as dry tinder whereby we may preſently be ſet on fire, or as a Barrel of Gun-powder (as I may ſay) within us, whereby he may come and blow us up. If we mortifie our ſins, then do we mortifie the world, and Satan in their power over us, but if we do not, then will the world be our Maſter, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will be Lord over us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Is it not neceſſary that we love God, and Chriſt, and his Commandments, and our own ſouls, and one another; but we love none of theſe, unleſs we mortifie the deeds of the body, we love not God, becauſe he hates thoſe Deeds, he is diſhonored by them, offended, and provoked, and his Spirit is grieved and quenched thereby, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. <hi>the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God, whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God,</hi> ſo as to every deed of the fleſh, the friendſhip thereof is enmity to God, whoſoever therefore is a friend thereof, is an enemy of God.</p>
               <p>Nor do we love Chriſt, becauſe the deeds of the body put him to death; and are quite contrary to the deeds which he did, <hi>If ye love me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>keep my Commandments,</hi> and if we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, we muſt needs break the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin, and ſo mortifie the deeds of the body.</p>
               <p>Nor do we love the Commandments of God and Chriſt, becauſe all ſinful deeds are directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite thereto, and this is one of the Lords Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that we mortifie our ſins, yea every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment implyes this, in that we can keep no
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97673:43"/>Command truely, heartily, unleſs our luſts are mortified,</p>
               <p>Nor do we love our own ſouls, becauſe all the deeds of the body, <hi>war againſt it,</hi> and are deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to it, to let ſin live quietly in us, is too plainly to hate our ſouls, for it is to give entertainment to the enemy, the worſt enemy of them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.24. <hi>he that is partner with a Thief, hateth his own ſoul, he heareth curſing, and bewrayeth it not,</hi> ſo doth he hate his own ſoul, who hath this and that luſt ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in him, and deſtroyeth it not.</p>
               <p>Nor do we love, or can we love one another in truth, for true love only groweth in a pure heart, hence it's ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Seeing ye have puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your ſouls in obeying the truth through the ſpirit, unto unfeigned love of the brethren, ſee that ye love one another, with a pure heart fervently,</hi> but no heart purity, except the corruptions of the heart be ſlain, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. <hi>from whence come wars, and fightings among you,</hi> (he meaneth quarrels, ſtrifes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions which are cauſed by want of love (<hi>come they not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>even of your luſts, that war in your members?</hi> Yes, thence it's ſure they come, there would be no wars nor fightings of any kind, but for the luſts that are in men, and whence is it that mens luſts do cauſe any ſuch things but becauſe they are not mortified?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let me ask, is it not neceſſary that we hate our corruptions? either we muſt hate them or we ſhall love them, but we do not hate them in good earneſt, with a right hatred, except we ſeek the mortification of them, no hatred of ſin is true and right which is not deadly, which doth not carry us forth in endeavours to trample it dead under our feet, to crucifie it, and let out it's heart blood. As when <hi>Cain</hi> hated his brother, he kill'd him, all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97673:43"/>heart hatred inclines a man to wiſh, and if it may be to ſeek the death of its object. Hence we read 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15 <hi>Whoſo hateth his brother is a Murderer, and ye know that no Murderer hath eternal life abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Is it not neceſſary that we eſcape con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in the day of judgment? but this we cannot unleſs we mortifie the deeds of the body, for the Scripture aſſures us in that day <hi>the Lord will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every one according to his deeds,</hi> Rom. 2.5, 6. <hi>Now is the day of ſalvation, now is the accepted time,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. but yet after a little while there will be a day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, and then, O then, even then, will the Lord God himſelf, render to every one of us according to our deeds; but what are our deeds? <hi>A.</hi> The deeds of the body of ſin are our deeds if we mortifie them not, for then we allow them, as they ſay the receiver is as bad as the thief, ſo, if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and give way to the luſtings, and out-goings of corrupt nature, we make our ſelves even as bad as it, we are as guilty as the old man the body of ſin is, they are as partners with their corruption, who ſeek not its deſtruction, therefore according to all the deeds of our corruption will the Lord render to us in that day if we mortifie them not, but, O! Alas! what a recompenſe? what wo? what ſore puniſhment? when God, even the moſt High and Almighty one himſelf; and that in the day of wrath; ſhall render to a poor creature, a miſerable man, according to all the luſts, and luſtings of ſin, all the members, and motions, and works of the body of ſin in him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Is it not neceſſary that we perform ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice to God? This will not be, cannot be, that we ſerve or worſhip God, ſo that what we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97673:44"/>do, ſhould be accepted of him, unleſs we mortifie the affections and motions of ſin within us, for our iniquities if not ſubdued will defile all we do, ſo that it will be loathſom and abominable to God, our luſts if ſuffered to live in us, will either quite draw us off from ſerving God, or they will mortifie all our ſervices, they will make them as dead ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, altogether odious and hateful to the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11, 12, &amp;c. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of your ſacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>bring no more vain oblations, Incenſe is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me, the new Moons and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſemblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity, the ſolemn meeting. Your new Moons, and your appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Feaſts my ſoul hateth; they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to hear them.</hi> Why? becauſe their luſts were unmortified, therefore it's ſaid, v. 16. <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings, from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil.</hi> And no wonder, for if our luſts are let alone, and entertained as friends, not dealt with as enemies, then are not our hearts upright with God, we are no better than Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in all that we do. Corruption living and prevailing keeps our hearts from God, it fetters, impriſoneth, and ſhackles our ſouls that they cannot follow after God. Every luſt, any one ſin not mortified, it doth bind a man hand and foot, as to any right performance to God; ſo it will be moſt juſt for Chriſt to ſay to all whoſe ſins are not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified (as he foretells us he will ſay) <hi>Take them, bind them hand and foot, and caſt them into outer darkneſs;</hi> becauſe they ſuffered themſelves, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, to be taken and bound hand and foot by their corruptions, And would not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by deſtroying them, to ſet themſelves at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they might walk in the light, therefore,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97673:44"/>take them you Executioners of my wrath, take them, and bind them, hand and foot, and caſt them into outer darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Let me add but this, is it not neceſſary that we ſhould have Communion with God, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt? but how ſhall this be? ſure our ſins muſt firſt be mortified, becauſe the Father is moſt holy, and the Son is moſt holy; ſhould God grant us Communion with himſelf, while any of our corruptions are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, and not wounded, not brought under, but have dominion in us, he muſt have fellowſhip with them, even with our ſins, which is impoſſible, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? and what Communion hath light with darkneſs? and what Concord hath Chriſt with</hi> Belial?</p>
               <p>We are exhorted <hi>to have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs,</hi> but we have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the deeds of the body of ſin, if we comply with them, and mortifie them not, and we thereby, have Communion with Satan; It is as ſure ſome have Communion with Satan in this world, as it is that ſome have fellowſhip with God, and who are they who have Communion with Satan, but ſuch whoſe hearts are in league with their ſins, therefore ſuch can have no fellowſhip with God, nor can it be that God ſhould draw nigh to them in a way of Communion. So then, I need ſay no more, it abundantly appears it is neceſſary, of exceeding great neceſſity that we do mortifie the deeds of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 5. Why is this to be done conſtantly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is a duty and work about which we muſt be converſant, wherein we muſt be exerciſed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, all the dayes of our life, therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith if ye mortifie, not if ye have morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, noting to us, that this is a buſineſs we are daily, all our life long, to be employed in. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hereof are manifeſt.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:97673:45"/>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe (as hath before been ſaid) the body of ſin continueth in all, while their natural viſible body liveth in this world, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf complains, and cryeth out becauſe <hi>of this body of death,</hi> of ſin which is as death, and this body of ſin is ſtill bringing forth ſowr grapes, vile fruit, there are new luſtings of corruption every day, hence we read, <hi>the fleſh lusteth againſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that is conſtantly, daily, and <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.5. <hi>the ſpirit that is in us luſteth to envy,</hi> ſo it luſteth to worldlineſs, to diſcontent, impatience, pride, wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore we muſt conſtantly keep warring againſt our ſin, its motions are ſtill renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore we muſt ſtill renew our blows, our oppoſition, our endeavour for their mortification, a if fire break forth, and it be beaten in, or quench't, yet ſo that it is ſtill burning, ſtill flaming and iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth again, then there is greet need, why there ſhould be ſtill endeavours to extinguiſh it. But the bare continuance, and conſtant working of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Satan is ſtill endeavouring to quicken the deeds of the body, he is ſtill ſeeking to ſtir up this and the other luſt in us, to ingender, hatch, or beget new ſinful motions in us, in our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The body of ſin, is (as I may call it) Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's daughter, yet harlot, he is ſtill doing all he can to cauſe new births, to make corruption fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, therefore we ſhould ſtill be mortifying our ſins, or we give him encouragement, we yield to him, if one be endeavouring ſtill to burn down your houſe, your city, had you not need ſtill to ſtand ready with water, and whenever any flame appears, to beſtir your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What ever arguments or reaſons there are, why we ſhould begin, and at any time mortifie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97673:45"/>the deeds of corruption, the ſame arguments, the ſame reaſons there are, why we ſhould continue, and hold on in ſo doing; our luſts are ſtill the ſame in their own nature at one time, as at another, God abhors them alwayes alike, they are ſtill as contrary to him, as full of enmity to our ſouls, the luſtings of ſin at all times deſerve death, and have a tendency to bring us unto death; ſo in all other reſpects, we have the ſame motives to quicken us in the carrying on this holy war.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they who have begun to ſeek the death of their ſins, have more reaſon to go forward even than they had to begin, haſt thou begun to deſtroy the viperous brood of luſts in thy ſoul, reaſon enough thou hadſt to begin, and wo had been to thee, if thou hadſt never begun to deſtroy theſe Vermin, Serpents, and much worſe, but yet thou having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, haſt more reaſon to go on, and continue deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them while thou liv'ſt. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The more thou haſt done, the leſs thou haſt to do, if thou holdeſt on, or the more thou haſt done, the more eaſie will it be for thee to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in ſo doing, every work is hardeſt at firſt, and ſo is this; the longer the Souldier hath been in the war and the more execution he hath done, the better may he hold on in his warfare, and ordinarily the more is he encouraged, the more reſolute and couragious is he, as alſo the more able, old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are look'd upon as the beſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The longer thou haſt been occupied or buſied in this work, the leſs while haſt thou to ſweat in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Knowing the times, that now it is high time to awake out of ſleep, for now is our ſalvation nearer than when we believed.</hi> So the utter deſtruction of our ſin, is nearer than when we began to make war upon it, ſo long as thou haſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97673:46"/>been mortifying thy luſts, ſo much ſhorter thy life, and therefore the life of thy luſts alſo, thy end, and therefore their end, is ſo much the nearer, and thou art ſo much the nearer heaven where thou ſhalt have no more ſuch work to do, where thou ſhalt neither have any ſinful luſting, nor any ſin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To give over, having begun, is a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime, a greater evil than to have never begun; he that never liſteth himſelf, or never marcheth forth, offends leſs than he that doth, and runs from his Colours, or returns before the fight be ended, (unleſs his Captain ſend him back, which the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our ſalvation never doth any) but in this ſpiritual warfare it's yet much worſe, for he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, who holds his hand, he (as it were) enters into a new league, and makes a new compoſition with his ſin, and that after light and conviction, for none begin, but ſuch who are inlightned, and convinced, which aggravates greatly their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with their ſin, <hi>He mortifieth his convictions, who keeps not on in mortifying his corruptions.</hi> Yea, if thou yieldeſt thy ſelf after reſiſtance made againſt thy ſin, to be carried down the ſtream, thou doſt then reſiſt the ſpirit, for that it was that put thee on at firſt to ſtrike at and attempt the death of thy luſts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thou wilt loſe all thy former labour, and endeavour, and worſe than loſe it,</p>
               <p>Loſe it it's ſure thou wilt, for thou wilt be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by thy ſins, he that doth his utmoſt, may be and is ſometimes captivated, as the Apoſtle ſaith he was by ſin, but they who lay down their Arms, or ſtand ſtill, will be quite conquered; as ſuppoſe an Enemy ſcale the Walls of a City, if thoſe within only knock down and kill for a while thoſe who ſeek
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97673:46"/>to enter, and don't continue to ſlay, while there are more and more ſtill powred in upon them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that have been ſlain, the City will ſoon be taken, maſtered, and brought under the Enemies power; So it is here, and if any are quite overcome by their corruptions, they will periſh by them, notwithſtanding any former conqueſt gained againſt, or over them. Though thou haſt mortified a 100 and a 100 luſtings of the fleſh, though thou haſt kept under thy ſins never ſo long, if after all, thou ſitteſt ſtill, they'l become thy Maſter, and they'l ſtrangle thy ſoul, they'l ſtab thee to thy heart, and carry thee to perdition.</p>
               <p>So will all thy former pains and warring be loſt, be as if it had not been. Yea, I ſay, it will be worſe than loſt, for thy corruption will grow the more violent, as a ſtream that's ſtop'd a while; thy luſts will become the more furious, as an Enemy that hath been of't beaten, and at length gets the upper hand, he is the worſe he's the more cruel. And God will puniſh the more ſorely, all who don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but let fall, the war againſt their luſts. If any think this not true, but ſhall bleſs themſelves in what's paſt, and grow ſecure, ſlothful, careleſs and take their eaſe, giving their corruption leave even to work as it will, and putting themſelves under the feet of their fleſh; let ſuch read (and reading trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) thoſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his 2 Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2. Chap. 19 and 20 v. <hi>while they promiſe others liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption, for of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought in bondage, for if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning,</hi> the more a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97673:47"/>diſeaſe is medled with, if after it be let alone and prevail it will kill the ſooner. But I paſs to the Application.</p>

Had a man only one luſt to grapple with, it were no eaſie thing to keep it under, how then can it be eaſie to ſubdue many evil affections? many there are in every one, all which muſt be mortified; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith not, if ye <hi>mortifie</hi> this or that deed, but <hi>the deeds of the body,</hi> that is, all of them though many.</p>
                  <p>God ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> when he had ſinned, <hi>in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of the ground all the dayes of thy life, thorns alſo and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth, in the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread till thou return to the ground.</hi> The earth it's bringing forth thorns and thiſtles ſeems to be ſpoken as one reaſon, why <hi>Adam</hi>'s life, ſhould be a life of ſorrow and labour, and this is one thing that makes the life of a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man laborious and painful, when their ground is ſtill bringing forth thorns and thiſtles or ſuch like things, which muſt be deſtroyed time after time. It's ſure this makes the life of a Chriſtian, one that is truely ſet, and bent heaven-ward, full of trouble and labour, he hath luſtings within, far worſe than briars and thorns, more hard to be ſubdued, and yet more neceſſary to be mortified. By this then (for one thing) it may be known that many people are not in the way to heaven (becauſe they live (as to all ſpiritual ſoul work) a lazy, ſlothful life, ſure ſuch are not wont daily to mortifie the deeds of the body; therefore are they not ſuch who walk in the way of life, unleſs we ſhall think (which Scripture permits not) that they have a priviledge above all others, to be quite freed from the body of ſin, which if they had, they would be more favoured than any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97673:48"/>man ever was in this life. What a work have we with a diſeaſe when it gets rooted in our bodies, what pains, what means, Purging, Sweating, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? and what time e're we can get it mortified? much more difficult to get a luſt ſubdued, which is natural, which was in the ſeed of it, bred and born in us. Is it not hard work to deal with a ſtrong enemy, who hath got into the heart of the Country, who hath divers ſtrong holds, and is oft ſallying forth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Doleful, and next dore to deſperate is their caſe, who are ſo far from mortifying the deeds of the body, that they nouriſh and cheriſh them, they help and quicken them, they make proviſion for the fleſh, which the Apoſtle warns us not to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. laſt, <hi>Make no proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> but ſome even make all proviſion for it, they feed their corruptions, they ſtir up their luſts, by giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to think of thoſe things that tend thereto, by running upon occaſions of ſin, ventring boldly upon manifeſt temptations, by their exceſſive uſing the good creatures of God, and other wayes, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.5. <hi>they live in pleaſure, and nouriſh their hearts as in a day of ſlaughter,</hi> they ſo live, that they make the body of ſin in them exceeding ſtrong and luſty, plump, and fat, and accordingly its deeds are the more numerous, groſs, and notorious, as the moſt ſtrong and luſty people have commonly the ſtrongeſt, and luſtieſt Children. Sad is their caſe, who do not mortifie their luſts, exceeding ſad then, ſad with a witneſs, is their caſe, their condition who do the contrary, when their fleſh luſteth, they heap fuel on the fire, and if corruption ſtir not of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, they venture to call it forth, as if they ſhould (like mad men) call to their worſt moſt inveterate enemies to come and hack and hew them, cut their throats, or ſtab them through the heart.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:97673:48"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Be not you diſcouraged, who are daily exerciſed in this work of mortifying your ſins; though you can't at preſent quite win the field, and drive your enemies out, but they are ſtill rallying their forces and aſſaulting you, yet while you keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, and beating them down, be not diſcouraged; becauſe this is a work not to be iſſued, till you have finiſhed your courſe. It is not therefore to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that you ſhould ſo ſubdue your corruption as no more to be troubled with it, while you are in this evil world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. Hinder not one another, but rather, as you may, help each other in this work, becauſe it is ſo neceſſary to be done; do nothing (ſo far as you can help it) that will ſtir up corruption in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but do what in you lyeth to prevent, and ſtop the workings of ſin in thoſe with whom you live, walk and converſe. It is too common a thing, and a great evil among men, they blow up ſin in one another, they ſtir up luſt in one another, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then one the other in evil, by ill councel, entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perſwaſion, or by ſome vain naughty diſcourſe, or by provoking and vexing, or by ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by laying ſtumbling blocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be you ware of all ſuch things;</p>
                  <p>And whenever you ſee any under the working of any ſin, ſo ſpeak, ſo walk, ſo carry it towards them, that you may be helpful to them in the mortifying thereof, for this purpoſe remember theſe counſels, and ſuch like, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Let us not be deſirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 1 Cor. 8.9. <hi>take heed lest by any means, your liberty become a ſtumbling block to them that are weak.</hi> Rom. 12.21. <hi>Overcome evil with good.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.14. <hi>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97673:49"/>ſupport the weak, be patient toward all men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 6. Conſider and try each one as to himſelf, do you indeed mortifie the Deeds of the body?</p>
                  <p>You may here take notice of four or five things;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle ſaith not, if ye mortifie your ſelves; a man may himſelf in his natural viſible body be mortified, and yet his ſins not be mortified, ſome have made away with themſelves, but they carried their luſts away with them, as <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> ſome have macerated themſelves, almoſt ſtarved themſelves, yet the body of ſin and the deeds thereof, have been fat and flouriſhing, they have put themſelves to much ſuffering, and yet their luſts have lived ſtill, and ſome are much mortified in their outward man, by great afflictions, by old age, yet their ſinful affections have had no wound thereby, though perhaps through the weakneſs of their bodies, ſome of them have not ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, as they were wont. Yet in ſome caſes, keeping under the body is a helpful means to the ſubduing of luſt, (ſo be it, it be not in a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious way) hence that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body and bring it into ſubjection, leſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle ſpeaks not of mortifying your temptations to ſin, (though theſe are to be avoided) a man may not have thoſe temptations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ich he had, his temptations may be as mortified, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> is the ſame in a ſtorm and in a calm, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>nd is ſtill, that is ſtill, but the nature of the ſea is not changed; ſo a mans corruption may not work as it did, though it be the ſame that it was, becauſe he is not tempted as he was.</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:97673:49"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Apoſtle ſpeaks not of hiding, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and cloaking the deeds of the fleſh, ſo that they ſhould not appear to men, this may be, a mans ſins may be hid, and yet be as and more lively in him, than when they did ſhew themſelves; <hi>Abſalom</hi> hid his malice againſt his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> but it lived and increaſed in him all the while; the Scribes and Phariſees covered their malice againſt Chriſt, when they came to him and gave him good words, but never more malicious than at that very time; ſo <hi>Judas</hi> cloaked his covetouſneſs; the truth is, this hiding and cloaking ſin, is a great deed of the fleſh, it is Hypocriſie; a Hypocrite through his ſhews and pretenſes may ſeem to others, yea and to himſelf, (for many Hypocrites deceive themſelves) to have his luſts in a great degree deſtroyed, and yet they have as much and more life than ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle ſaith not, if ye reſtrain, hold, or ſtop the working of ſin, this may alſo be, corruption may be a while reſtrained, through af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, conviction, common workings, and yet be far from any degree of death, as <hi>Saul</hi>'s envy was reſtrained, and ſtop'd, inſomuch that he ceaſed his purſuing <hi>David,</hi> yet his heart was full of envy ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Apoſtle ſpeaks not of changing the deeds of the body one for another, as Prodigality for covetouſneſs, open prophaneſs for formality, or the like, this oft is, a man ſteps out of one dirty path into another, he leaves one way of death, and walks in another, but ſo that he is never the nearer life, becauſe, though his ſin be changed, it's not mortified. Theſe things might have been enlarged, but I have only hinted them, yet are they worthy of great conſideration, it's not ſaid if ye mortifie your ſelves, nor if ye mortifie your temptations, or they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97673:50"/>be mortified, nor if ye cover and cloak your ſins, nor if ye reſtrain and ſtop your luſts in their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor if you change your corruptions one for another, but if you mortifie your iniquities, if you kill, and truely deſtroy the deeds of the body of ſin; it is this, and nothing leſs than this, the actual real ſlaying our luſtings, and luſts, that is neceſſarily required to life.</p>
                  <p>See then that you miſtake nor, ſearch, examine, prove your ſelves concerning this, is it ſo that ye do actually truly kill, ſlay your ſins, take away their very life? are you really bent in your hearts to this work, and intent upon this buſineſs?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How ſhall we know that?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. If ſo, you make uſe of all means you know or hear of, in ſeeking the mortification of the deeds of the fleſh. If men ſeek to kill any hurtful creature, to deſtroy an enemy, they not only do ſomething, but every thing they know or are told may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thereto till their deſign be accompliſh'd. If one means do not do, they uſe another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till there be no more that they can do. So you uſe all means to deſtroy the deeds of ſin in you, there is no one thing, you know, or are told that is a good lawful means for the ruining the luſtings of the fleſh, but you give your ſelves to the practiſe thereof; yea, you are inquiſitive ſtill, what is yet to be done, as that young man ſaid to Chriſt. <hi>What lack I yet,</hi> ſo you ſay, what is more to be done for the ſlaying my ſin. And you have a readineſs to embrace any direction, that from Scripture, or good and warrantable experience you may be acquainted with. Yea, it is no ſmall joy and delight to you to hear how you may overcome your iniquities; if you hear any thing you before have not known, or taken notice of, it is to you as if you heard ſome means to cure a ſore and deadly diſeaſe.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:97673:50"/>
                  <p>Secondly, You endeavour to mortifie inward ſecret ſins, as really, as cordially as outward open ſins, thoſe which are known only to God, as well, and as much as thoſe which are manifeſt in the ſight of men. And you do follow every ſin to its natural ſeat, to your heart, and there ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, as men that follow their enemies to their doors, and ſeek to ruine them there where they dwell, or are entrench'd, ſo you follow your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and do your utmoſt to deſtroy them, not only in their appearances abroad, but within, where they dwell and lodge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You ſearch after your ſins, not being content your ſelves to mortifie thoſe you know, but you enquire, and look without, and within, and round about, whether there be not ſome that you know not, as one who in war ſearcheth after his enemies, to find out thoſe that hide themſelves in the hedges, behind the buſhes, among the trees, or in any ſecret place. It's ſaid of ungodly men they make a diligent ſearch after the ſins of thoſe they bare ill will to, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 64.6. <hi>they ſearch out iniquities, they accompliſh a diligent ſearch.</hi> So a gracious ſoul, who hates his ſins with a perfect deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, he ſearcheth out his own iniquities, he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſheth (not only begins, but goes through ſtitch with) a diligent ſearch; divers ſins lye ſecret, ſo deep, and ſtick ſo cloſe they are not eaſily to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, therefore one whoſe heart is truly ſtirred in holy zeal againſt his ſins, he ſearcheth narrowly diligently, (as that woman Chriſt ſpeaks of for her loſt groat) that he may come to the knowledge of them, in order to their mortification.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If you are engaged with your whole ſoul in this work, then you do get ground upon the deeds of the fleſh, they are really weakned, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97673:51"/>impaired (as the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> before <hi>David</hi>) right endeavours wherein the whole ſoul is employed are not in vain, if they are in outward matters, yet are they not in ſpiritual things; a man may with all his heart do his utmoſt to get rid of a ſickneſs, and yet it grow upon him, and increaſe. But it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as to our luſts, he doth prevail and proſper, who in ſincerity and good earneſt is engaged againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> How ſhall we know that, whether we get ground upon our corruptions or no?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. If your ſpirits are more conſtantly, than they uſe to be, in a gracious holy frame, the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth, and ſtrong workings of any corruption ſpoileth the preſent graciouſneſs, and ſpiritual frame of our ſpirits, if then you are more conſtantly in a godly heavenly temper, as if you have more holy thoughts, if your minds do more frequently and freely work upon God, the words, and things of God, if you have more conſtant breathings after God, if you now have a more continued readineſs to do good works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then do you gain upon your luſts, if you are not ſo oft (as we ſay) off the hooks, out of tune in your ſpirits, in a carnal, vain, liſtleſs, careleſs, drowſy and ſinful temper.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If when corruption moves and gets advantage againſt you, it doth leſs miſchief, than it uſe to do, though it doth hurt, yet not ſo much, it may diſcompoſe you, put you beſides your Bias ſomewhat, but not in ſo great a degree, it alters the frame of your ſpirit, but not altogether, not ſo as to lay all waſt, as formerly. But even then, when ſin ſtirs moſt, you find grace with all ſtirring much, as fear of God, diſlike of ſinful luſting, and riſing of heart againſt it more than at ſuch times was wont to be.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:97673:51"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, If you find your heart upon reflection, and a review of the workings of your ſpirits, and your converſations more ready to ſee the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages thereof, and what of ſin hath been therein, as alſo more enlarged in confeſſing and judging your ſelves for the deeds of the fleſh, and more grieved, broken, aſhamed, and humbled for them; the more of theſe things, the more are your ſins mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, the more do you prevail againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If you are more fearful of ſin, leſt it ſhould break forth, and ſo more careful to prevent the ſtirrings of corruption, and more fervent in crying to God, day by day, to <hi>order all your ſteps in his paths,</hi> to keep your hearts, and to enable you to <hi>order your converſations aright,</hi> according to his will, if you can, and do more earneſtly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſent that petition, Lord, that <hi>thy will may be done by me on Earth, as it is in Heaven,</hi> or to that effect.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If when ſin doth ſtir, it is more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſuppreſt than heretofore, you find perhaps the ſame ſinful motions ever and anon, but then they don't continue ſo long as they did; you ſooner quench them, or get them down underfoot. It ſpeaks a full victory coming on, when the enemies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts are more ſudde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly quaſht, ſo if the workings of ſin are more ſpeed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>

                     </gap>aſht and turn'd back; And when you ſooner reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er your ſelves, and come to a right frame; I may add,</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If it be now more eaſie to you to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand temptations, and to ſtand out againſt the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and movings of ſin, this ſpeaks corruption hath ſome conſiderable wound, and that it is dying, when a man hath a leſs adoe to quell it, and maſter it. Yet conſideration muſt be had of a time of ſpecial extraor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ary temptation, It is poſſible, a mans
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97673:52"/>ſin may be ſorely wounded, and yet out-reach him, and give him ſuch a fall as it never did before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may meet with ſuch a trial as all things laid together, he had not before, which was <hi>Noah</hi>'s, <hi>Lot</hi>'s and <hi>David</hi>'s caſe.</p>
                  <p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 7. Let me ſpeak a little to excite you to give your ſelves more and more to this neceſſary Duty, Neceſſity (they ſay) hath no Law; Nothing muſt be hearkned to, or regarded, to ſtop a man in a caſe of abſolute neceſſity, which is very true, as to the matter in hand: becauſe this is moſt neceſſary, nothing muſt let us, we muſt break through all oppoſition and ſhake off all diſcouragement, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we neglect, this muſt not be neglected. How oſt is neceſſity pleaded as to the things of this world, I am neceſſitated, ſaith one, ſaith another, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity to do this or that, O remember no neceſſity in any worldly matter like to this. Some plead a neceſſity of ſinning, as <hi>Eſau</hi> for the ſelling his birth-right, <hi>I am at the point to dye</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.32. but we know there can be no true ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſin, unleſs we ſhall ſay it's neceſſary for a man to provoke God, and deſtroy himſelf, or ſuch a neceſſity ſhall be pleaded as this, it's neceſſary to ſave a penny, though thereby a man beggar himſelf, It's neceſſary for a man to ſave his cloaths though thereby he loſe his life. But behold neceſſity indeed, this is true neceſſity; this is neceſſity in the language and judgement of ſound wiſdom, to mortifie all the corruptions of our ſouls: and what need more be ſaid? Yet take a word or two beſides what hath been ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we do not mortifie the deeds of the body, they will mortifie all Ordinances to us, we ſhall not get good by any Ordinance of God, all will be as dead to us, Baptiſm will become as no Baptiſm to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97673:52"/>us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. The Lords Supper will become as no Lords Supper to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. <hi>This is not to eat the Lords Supper,</hi> to eat it with ſin unmortified; hearing the Word will be as no hearing the Word of God, Chriſt tells us, <hi>Briars and Thorns choak the Word,</hi> and <hi>ſtones,</hi> luſts unſubdued, <hi>cauſe it to wither,</hi> by hindring its taking <hi>root.</hi> It's true, Ordinances are appointed for the mortifying our corruptions, that's one great end of them, but if our hearts be not ſet upon the mortifying our ſins, if we let them alone, and give way to them, what hope that Ordinances ſhall profit us? The firſt good any get by Ordinances (unleſs any are brought to it by afflictions) is to ſtir them up to make War upon their luſts, or nothing is done to purpoſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this be done. Hence it's ſaid, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he'l draw nigh to you, cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts, ye double minded.</hi> No good, no advantage by Ordinances, no life in them, unleſſe God draw nigh to us in them, and if we would that God ſhould draw nigh to us in any Ordinance, we muſt draw nigh to him therin; but this we cannot unleſs we give our ſelves to the cleanſing of our hands, and the purifying of our hearts; that is, in a word, to the mortifying of our ſins, both outward, and inward; chiefly Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; therefore he ſaith, purifie your hearts, ye double minded, but if we give way to any of our ſins, we give way to Hypocriſie, we are double-minded, and double-hearted, in our approaching the Preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we do not mortifie our corruptions, they will, yea they'l cauſe us to mortifie whatever good motions or purpoſes are in us, one of theſe two muſt be, either we muſt deſtroy our ſins, or through them, we ſhall deſtroy that which is contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97673:53"/>for good and evil cannot both be together in the ſoul with allowance, if we ſo allow that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as not to ſeek the deſtruction of it, we ſhall ſo diſallow all good that's contrary to it, as not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to live in us; And ſo we ſhall joyn hands with Satan, for that's it he ſeeketh, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.4. <hi>The Dragon stood before the woman, which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her Child as ſoon as it was born,</hi> ſo he ſtands ready to devour the child of every good motion, purpoſe, conviction, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is at any time in us: Take heed therefore that you do not put that good that is in you, as it were into Satan's mouth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Have you not liſted your ſelves under Chriſts Banner? have you not taken Chriſt's Name upon you? therefore you ought to war againſt, and ſeek the death of all ſin in you; Chriſt Jeſus, the Captain of our Salvation expects this of all who enroll their Names as Souldiers under him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Lie not one to another, ſeeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds,</hi> Ye who make a profeſſion of Chriſt, have done this at leaſt by profeſſion, profeſſing Chriſt, ye do profeſs to have put off your former corrupt nature, with the deeds thereof: if then you mortifie them not, you contradict your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>And if you are, as you would ſeem, Chriſtians indeed, then are you members of Chriſt, therefore are you obliged to mortifie your members that are on the earth; you are of the Myſtical Body of Chriſt, therefore ſhould withal induſtry ſeek to deſtroy the deeds of the body of ſin; and that the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was one end of Chriſts death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97673:53"/>that we ſhould morrifie it, for either we are, ſhall, and muſt be the enemies of ſin, or we are, and ſhall be the Servants of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs;</hi> but we are not dead to ſin, nor can we live unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, if we ſubdue not the evil deeds of the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This is acceptable ſervice to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our corruptions are enemies to him as well as to us, and he calls us forth to war againſt them: therefore when we endeavour their ruine we ſerve God; and God takes it as ſervice to himſelf, and he will graciouſly therefore reward it at laſt with his bleſſings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Melchizedeck, King of Salem, Prieſt of the moſt High God, met with Abraham re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the ſlaughter of the Kings, and bleſſed him.</hi> Melchizedeck was a type of Chriſt, who is ſaid to be a <hi>Priest after the order of</hi> Melchizedeck; In the foregoing words, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. laſt <hi>verſe, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the Father of the faithful ſignifieth all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, his ſeed, his children. The Kings may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our luſts which naturally reign as Kings in us. <hi>Lot</hi> whom the Kings took captive, notes our ſouls captivated by our luſts; <hi>Abraham</hi>'s deſtroying thoſe Kings imports our deſtroying our corruptions, as Believers through faith; <hi>Melchizedech</hi> his bleſſing <hi>Abraham</hi> thereupon, ſpeaks and gives aſſurance of a bleſſing to us from Chriſt, we ſo doing. Would you that when you have finiſh'd your courſe, and fought the good fight of Faith, Chriſt Jeſus ſhould ſo come forth and meet you, and bleſs you; then up and be doing, up and be fighting; ſmite, kill and ſlay all your iniquities: This is fighting the Lords battel, therefore as it is ſaid of <hi>Meroz, Curſe them becauſe they came not forth to the help of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97673:54"/>the Lord againſt the mighty;</hi> ſo curſed is every one that goes not forth with all his might againſt his mighty ſins; But <hi>bleſſed he that takes</hi> Babilon<hi>'s children, yea her little ones</hi> (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks) <hi>and daſheth them againſt the stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, though to wound your natural viſible body, or any member thereof be an unnatural thing, cauſing grief and pain, to deſtroy the body of ſin, and its deeds is a gracious work, from whence flow peace and joy; <hi>Great peace have they who love thy Law,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, but the more any fight againſt their ſins, and deſtroy them, the more they do, and the more they thereby will, love the Law of God; Therefore awake to this good work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe laſt,</hi> Be ye conſtant in this work; Never give over in any caſe, any place, at any time, for you carry the body of ſin about you wherever you go, and there are allurements every where, and baits to draw it forth in evil luſtings.</p>
                  <p>It is too common a thing, and one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faults amongſt Chriſtians, that they are no more conſtant in this bleſſed work, ſometimes they beſtir themſelves herein, but at other times how negligent are they! they ſit down and fall aſleep at this great and neceſſary duty. Which how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is it to ſtand ſtill though but one hour, one quarter of an hour? in a hot cloſe fight hand to hand, is it not full of danger? ten to one the man that doth ſo is knockt down dead. But if by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this work you ſhould get no deadly wound, you would not eſcape ſome wound, which perhaps you ſhall not have cured a long while, it may be not while you live, and you'l find the work harder when you begin again, then you left it, when you left off; Some they grow weary and faint in this ſpiritual combate, but let them remember if they ſtop they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97673:54"/>muſt renew the fight again, and then however diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it be now, it will be more hard to them, for ſin gains ground when we ſit ſtill.</p>
                  <p>But hold on, and thus ſhall you find the work eaſier, and thus ſhall you have conſtant peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable, or long continued breach thereof; though ſin ſtir ſtrongly, yea though it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail much, yet while you keep diligent and conſtant in reſiſting, and oppoſing, and beating it down, your peace will abide. There is no inward true peace, but where there is inward war againſt ſin, and while this war is maintained and carried on, heartily, and vigorouſly, there is inward peace; for this is exceeding pleaſing to conſcience, that ſits as it were looking on, and is greatly pleaſed, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the ſoul luſtily wreſtling with, contending againſt, and purſuing to death its luſts and ſinful luſtings. Yea the Lord the Captain of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is highly pleaſed to behold this, and therefore will ſpeak peace to thoſe thus employed, and daily exerciſed. Go over your experience, and ſay, when have you the moſt peace? is it not then when you are moſt eagerly ingaged againſt and hot in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of ſin, plotting, contriving, and by all means you can working its death? The experience of all Chriſtians, I doubt not, gives in reſtimony that this is true.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond thing in the latter part of my Text now offereth it ſelf to our ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this neceſſary duty is to be performed through

               <p>
                  <hi>D.</hi> 2. That the great work of mortifying, killing or deſtroying the deeds of the body of ſin, is to be managed through the Spirit: when we are called upon to mortifie our ſinful affections, our evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the corrupt luſtings within us, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that this is to be done through the Spirit. No truth more uſeful than this, if well underſtood and received, this is the principal thing that I would commend to you. All know, or generally it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that ſins muſt be mortified, but that this is to be done by, in, with, or through the Spirit, few in compariſon underſtand. I know nothing that needs to be taught among, and preſt upon Chriſtians, and more frequently to be inculcated than this.</p>
               <p>There are three Queries concerning the truth now propoſed, which call for ſome Anſwer for the explication of it. 1. What's meant by the Spirit? 2. Why is this work to be done through the Spirit? 3. How is it thus to be done?</p>
               <p>Q. 1. <hi>What's meant by the Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Spirit ſignifieth diverſe things in Scripture, it hath ſeveral acceptations, 4 of which I ſhall here take notice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſpirit, is meant, our ſpirit, our heart and ſoul, ſo the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>he did ſerve God with his ſpirit,</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>God is to be worſhipped in ſpirit,</hi> ſo we muſt mortifie the deeds of the body of ſin, in ſpirit, with our whole heart, and ſoul, otherwiſe we ſhall not proſper in what we do, all will be to no purpoſe, if we have not a thorow will and ſincere endeavour, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>many ſhall ſeek to enter in at the ſtrait gate, and not be able,</hi> ſo many ſeek to mortifie their ſins, and are not able, becauſe they are not thorowly willing, and reſolved. And then our main endeavour muſt be to mortifie
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97673:55"/>ſin within (of which I ſpake before) when ſins are only kept from outward outbreakings, they are no more mortified, than Lions, and Bears, or ſuch wild creatures, when ſhut up and kept from rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometimes by ſpirit in Scripture is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, new nature, the new man, as it may be taken and ſeems to be in that, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 17. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh, and the fleſh against the ſpirit,</hi> thus we muſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſins in, by, or through the ſpirit, by the new creature, through a principle of true grace acted, and ſtirred up in us. This is moſt certain, no man can mortifie the deeds of ſin, without he have a contrary principle of grace, for till the new man be formed in one, there's no good, nothing but fleſh, but ſin, and the fleſh neither will, nor can mortifie it ſelf, as Satan caſteth not out Satan, neither doth luſt caſt out or deſtroy luſt; though it's true, ſometimes one luſt doth keep under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hinder anothers working this or that way, as a mans pride may put a ſtop to his covetouſneſs, though he have a covetous heart, yet through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant pride, he ſcorns to be baſe and niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo covetouſneſs may hold in pride as to it's ſhewing it ſelf in ſuch or ſuch a way, becauſe the man is coverous therefore he will not wear ſuch cloths, or do ſome other things, which pride other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would cauſe him to do, that he might have reſpect among men. But ſin cannot truely ſubdue ſin, no more than water can dry up water, though one ſtream being ſtronger, may ſtop, and turn the courſe of another, that hath leſs ſtrength, ſo pride may command covetouſneſs, or covetouſneſs pride, yet do they both live before God, as the greater light may drown the leſs, yet doth not extinguiſh it.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97673:56"/>He that hath not a principle of true grace is under the power of fin, therefore is not at liberty to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, or to will the mortification of his luſts in truth. If there be war, if there be killing, and ſlaying, there muſt be two parties, the one againſt the other, but in a graceleſs man there's only one party, one nature, one kind of principles, all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; therefore he cannot kill, or in truth ſet upon the ſlaying of his ſin, though he may poſſibly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome outward account, or to quiet conſcience ſeek to curb ſome evil motions. As it is againſt our nature as men to hurt our bodies, ſo is it againſt our nature as ſinful men to do any thing in good earneſt, and truth of heart, towards the death of our ſin. Therefore a man muſt have a new nature, which whoſoever hath, then he cannot but be ſtriking at, and wounding the deeds of corrupt nature, becauſe theſe two are perfectly contrary. Yet they who have true grace need to be awakned and excited thereto more and more to lay out themſelves therein, through that grace they have received; could it be that the actings of ſin ſhould be deſtroyed without contrary workings of grace, it would little avail, a man would not thereby be in the way of life, but no luſting of corruption can be truely killed without a luſting and ſtirring of grace in oppoſition thereto, as darkneſs is only diſpelled, removed by the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of ſome light. Therefore look O ſoul well to this, that thou haſt a new nature, that thou beeſt a new Creature in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Spirit is ſometimes taken for the Goſpel as oppoſed to the Covenant of works, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>miniſtration of the Spirit</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>miniſtration of Death,</hi> mentioned in the foregoing verſe; and <hi>verſe</hi> 6. he ſaith, <hi>we are Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97673:56"/>of the Letter, but of the Spirit,</hi> for the Letter killeth but the Spirit giveth life, and thus ſome take Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.8. There are three that bear witneſs on earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Word, the Goſpel, Baptiſm, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; If we take Spirit in my Text, in this ſenſe; It's true the deeds of the body are to be mortified through the Goſpel, by Goſpel truths and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, for it is the Goſpel only that is effectual to deſtroy our ſins, the Law is not ſufficient to kill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Luſt in us. It may be by legal truths men may be frighted, and chained (as it were) with the heavy chain of ſlaviſh fear, ſo that they dare not ſin as they uſed to do; but the Law alone never was or can be ſufficient to lay any ſin dead: The Law alone ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quickneth and ſtirreth up ſin, than deſtroyeth it; ſin is thereby revived, not mortified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Without the Law ſin was dead, i. e.</hi> it lay as if it had been ſo in compariſon of thoſe ſtirrings of it, which he found when the Law came to his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>When the Commandement came ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and I dyed, and the commandement which was ordained to life, I found to be unto Death,</hi> to his own death, the death of his former hope and comfort, not the death of his ſin; and thus he ſaith it was with others before converted, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>When we were in the fleſh the motions of ſin which were by the Law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death;</hi> the motions of ſin which were by the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> which were begotten or drawn forth by the Law through our corruption. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are Goſpel Truths eſpecially, and no Truths without theſe, that are an efficacious means for the mortifying of ſin; Theſe are the <hi>weapons of our warfare</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls them) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>which are not carnal, but mighty through God to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97673:57"/>pulling down of ſtrong holds,</hi> they are ſpiritual, and ſo effectual, through God, to the ſubduing our carnal affections. As the work of mortification is begun, ſo it is carried on, but it is begun in rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and that's by the Goſpel, as we read we are begotten again by that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus, I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> Therefore the Goſpel and the truths thereof ſhould principally be made uſe of; The curſe of the Law ſhould be conſidered, but if a man would get his ſin indeed deſtroyed, let him ſeek a ſpiritual underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and let him be much in meditating on the grace of the Goſpel, the doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By the Spirit is underſtood the Holy Ghoſt the third Perſon in the Trinity, thus it's taken both before my Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, and 11. as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo after my Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15, and 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in this ſenſe we are to take it in the words I am upon, <hi>if ye through the Spirit,</hi> through the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> through the Spirit of God <hi>do mortifie the deeds of the body.</hi> Yet this includes the three other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations of the word Spirit, for, whoever do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any ſin through the Holy Ghoſt, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the work with their whole ſouls, their whole heart is in it; and they do deſtroy the deeds of the fleſh by acting and exerciſing grace, and this they do through hearing, conſidering, and acting Faith on Goſpel Truths, as will be ſhewn after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>Why is this work of mortifying our ſins to be done by the Spirit of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe it cannot poſſibly be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit of God: Whatever is done againſt ſin without the Spirit, gives it no deaths wound; it only covers, or ſomewhat curbeth ſin, but doth not at all deſtroy it: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>It's
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97673:57"/>the Spirit that giveth life,</hi> or <hi>that quickneth,</hi> ſo it's the Spirit that mortifieth, the Spirit quickneth the Soul, and the Spirit mortifieth ſin in the Soul: A dead carkaſs ſhall as ſoon maintain a fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and kill a powerful enemy, as any man ſlay his ſin, any one luſt without the Spirit of God: As it is natural to our viſible body to ſave it ſelf, and every member thereof, ſo is it natural to the body of ſin, and every member of that to ſave it ſelf; and as it is natural to a Father to ſave his Child, ſo to Satan to do his utmoſt to defend and preſerve fin in us; Therefore it cannot be that we ſhould of our ſelves, or by the help of any creature alone, mortifie any luſt: could we without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt deſtroy our ſin, then might we be in a great part our own Saviours; He that knows not the neceſſity of the Spirits ſpecial aſſiſtance in this work, is certainly a great ſtranger to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin, that is moſt true in this caſe; <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> It is too great a work, too mighty, and too honourable, for any one of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to get the victory over ſin, which is our ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and our worſt enemy: Outward enemies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deſtroyed without the help of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when many and potent, much leſs can ſpiritual enemies which are the worſt and ſtrongeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.16, 17. <hi>There is no King ſaved by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of an hoſt, a mighty man is not delivered by much ſtrength, an horſe is a vain thing for ſafety; neither ſhall he deliver any by his great ſtrength;</hi> So all Means, Duties, Ordinances, Power and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Creature, is vain, weak, and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deliver and ſave a man from his ſin, unleſs the Spirit of the Lord put its hand to the work, and by its might effect it.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:97673:58"/>
               <p>Secondly, As this cannot be done without the Spirit, ſo may it be done by the Spirit, what though our luſts are never ſo many, <hi>It's all one</hi> (as we read) <hi>with the Lord to ſave with many or with few,</hi> ſo is it all one with him to deſtroy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or few, what was that great Hoſt of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> which came againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> one Angel of the Lord deſtroyed it in one night: we read of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, lest any be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin;</hi> every ſin is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceitful, (beſides how deceitful is the heart? how deceitful is Satan? how deceitful is the world?) which is one great reaſon why we cannot mortifie our evil affections of our ſelves, we want not only ſtrength, but underſtanding alſo; our Luſts ſeem dead, while in truth they live; they make us think we wound them, when the blow falls quite beſide, we ſeem many times to do all we can againſt our ſins when its nothing ſo, that ſin ſeems leaſt in us which is greateſt and moſt hurtful.</p>
               <p>Now the ſpirit of God is a ſpirit of wiſdom, therefore through it we may deſtroy our ſin not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its deceitfulneſs; though we oft are, the ſpirit of God cannot be, deceived. What though our iniquities are never ſo mighty, the ſpirit of God is Almighty, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 74.15. <hi>thou driedst up mighty rivers,</hi> yet dryed, and dryed up though rivers, though mighty rivers, or (as the word is) rivers of ſtrength; what great things did the ſpirit of God do in the creation, when it moved on the face of the waters, ſuch like things it can do, and doth when it moveth powerfully in our hearts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.3. <hi>The floods have lifted up O Lord, the floods have Dfted up their voice, the floods lift up their waves,</hi> what then, who can ſtill them, can any man? No,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97673:58"/>they (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks) make the Marriners at their wits end, they know not how to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, much leſs to quell and calm the floods when they do lift up their voice, and their waves to the higheſt, I but the Lord, the Spirit of our God is able to command them ſilence, as it there follows <hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>The Lord on high is mightier than the noiſe of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the Sea,</hi> ſo is no man (<hi>Darius</hi> found himſelf too weak to deal with the waves, when they broke his bridge of boats though he had a hundred thouſand men at his command) and is but laught at for his attempting by ſhackles, and ſtripes to tame the tempeſtuous waters, but Chriſt by commanding the ſea to ſilence, ſhew'd and made manifeſt, the power of God; Thus when our luſts lift up their voice, when our fleſh lifteth up its waves (as it were) in our ſouls, the Lord is more mighty, we are too weak to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with them, but the ſpirit of the Lord is mightier than the ſtrongeſt motions, and moſt mighty luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſin within us. It is ſometimes thought by ſome when they feel this or that luſt ſtirring ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and when they have laboured long againſt it, without conqueſt over it, can this luſt be ſubdued? can it ever be mortified? and ſure it is we are all too full of unbelief as to God's power, (However ſome imagine they believe it enough) hence they ſaid, <hi>can God prepare a Table in the wilderneſs?</hi> yea, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf (notwithſtanding all he had heard, ſeen, and experienced of the power of God) yet once ſpake doubtingly concerning it; <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.21, 22. for which God rebuked him, <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>ſaying, is the Lords hand waxed ſhort?</hi> and hence though the Prophet makes a full confeſſion of Gods power, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.17. <hi>Ah Lord God, behold thou haſt made the heaven and the earth by thy great power, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97673:59"/>ſtretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee,</hi> yet obſerve in the following verſes he ſeems to ſpeak too unbelievingly concerning God's power, ſo and ſo ſaith he it is with us, yet <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>thou haſt ſaid unto me, O Lord God, buy the field for money, and take witneſſes, for the City is given into the hands of the</hi> Caldeans, therefore <hi>v.</hi> 26.27. <hi>Then came the word of the Lord unto</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>ſaying, Behold I am the Lord, the God of all fleſh, is there any thing too hard for me?</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, thou ſay'ſt indeed there is nothing too hard for me, but thou haſt not ſo much faith of my power as thou oughteſt to have, thou haſt too much doubting, too much unbelief concerning my power it ſelf. But above all things, a ſoul under a deep ſenſe of the power of natural corruption, is prone to doubt of Gods power as to the deſtruction thereof, &amp; were there reaſon to doubt of the power of God in any thing, there would be cauſe to queſtion it in this, if even any thing were too hard for the Lord, this would, to ſlay thoſe luſts which grow in our corrupt nature; the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of deſtroying ſin in us the Apoſtle intimates, when he ſaith, <hi>who ſhall deliver me from this body of death.</hi> Wherefore this is needful to be declared, and to be urged, whatever our fins are, the ſpirit of the Lord can mortifie them, it can cauſe the body of ſin and all the luſts thereof to wither, and dye away, as Chriſt did that fig tree which he curſed, ſo that they ſhould no more bring forth any fruit.</p>
               <p>And the ſpirit of the Lord can ſo ſtrengthen and aſſiſt us, that though we be weak, we ſhall be ſtrong enough in its ſtrength, to lay dead every deed of ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. <hi>God hath choſen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty;</hi> out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings he can perfect
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97673:59"/>praiſe; There have been many who have had ſuch like luſts as ours are, who have been able, through the ſpirit to tread them under their feet; we read of ſeven Devils caſt out of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> not that ſhe was poſſeſs'd in her body, but ſhe was a notorious ſinner, ſhe had mighty luſts whereby the Devils had great power in, and over-her ſoul; <hi>If I ſaith Chriſt by the ſpirit caſt out Devils,</hi> there are no Devils, and ſo no luſts but may be caſt out by the ſpirit, ſo ſtrong was <hi>Paul</hi>'s envy, and malice before his Converſion, that <hi>Acts</hi> 26.11. <hi>he was exceeding mad againſt the Christians,</hi> yet by the ſpirit he of mad was made ſober, thoſe his luſts were deſtroyed, and inſtead of being mad againſt Chriſt he became as beſides himſelf for Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. <hi>whether we be beſides our ſelves it is to God,</hi> ſome accounted them becauſe of their ſelf denyal, and fervency in Preaching the Word, whereby they ſpent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as beſides themſelves, what luſts had they? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. they were <hi>ſome of them, for ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, Idolaters, Adulterers, Abuſers of themſelves with mankind, Thieves, Covetous, Drunkards, Extortioners,</hi> the worſt of ſinners, yet were they <hi>ſanctified by the ſpirit of our God,</hi> and if they were ſanctified, then their luſts were mortified through the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Therefore believe that your ſins by the ſpirit may alſo be deſtroyed, it is a good ſtep towards the doing this, to believe that through the ſpirit, it may be done; and the believing this is neceſſary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.28, 29. <hi>Believe ye that I am able to do this? they ſaid, yea Lord,</hi> then touched he their eyes, ſaying, <hi>according to your faith be it unto you,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> according to their faith of Chriſt's ability) ſo were their eyes opened.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All whom the Lord hath choſen to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97673:60"/>he hath elected them to this way, through mortification of their ſin by the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through ſanctification of the ſpirit unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> through ſanctification, and therefore through mortification, how? by the ſpirit, ſo 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>We are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, Brethren, beloved of God, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation through ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ſpirit;</hi> but no more ſanctification of our ſouls, than there is mortification of our luſts.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Jeſus Chriſt dyed for this, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>he was manifeſted to take away our ſins, and in him is no ſin;</hi> to take them away, that is not only in the guilt of them, but in the power and life of them, and it is of the latter he there ſpeaks, as the context ſhews <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>whoſoever abideth in him ſinneth not;</hi> that is, he hath his ſins taken away by him, and ſo he ſinneth not as he did, nor as others do, not with his whole man, not with delight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as Chriſt came and dyed for this, that our ſins might be mortified, ſo that this might be done by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in that it cannot be done without it, and hence Chriſt ſpeaks of ſending the ſpirit after his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſixion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, to deal with men about their fins, and why? but in order to the ſubduing them, and that becauſe for this he dyed, and alſo roſe, and aſcended and interceeds, that thoſe whom he ſaves may have the ſpirit, to help them in this work.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, God hath promiſed his ſpirit to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you,</hi> for what? <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>I will ſave you from all your uncleanneſſes,</hi> that is, God will put his ſpirit within his people to ſave them from their ſins, and when are we ſaved from our ſins? when they are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97673:60"/>killed, we are ſaved from them, this alſo is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>I'le ſprinkle clean water upon you, I'le give you,</hi> that is, my ſpirit, <hi>and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs,</hi> viz. ſpiritual filthineſs, or ſinfulneſs. This alſo is included in that promiſe, <hi>Iſa</hi> 44.3, 4. <hi>I'le pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and they ſhall ſpring up as among the graſs, as willows by the water courſes,</hi> that is, they ſhall thrive and flouriſh ſpiritually, they ſhall grow in knowledge and grace, go forward in good, but there is no thriving ſpiritually, encreaſing or growing in grace, without the mortification of ſin, only ſo far as ſin dyeth, doth grace grow, therefore God there, by conſequence or in effect, promiſeth his ſpirit, to ſlay ſin in his people.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, God hath actually given his ſpirit to his people, all who are effectually called, all who are in Chriſt: for this end, haſt thou the ſpirit of God in thee? it was given thee, as by God, ſo for ſome end, what end? partly this, that thereby thou mighteſt mortifie the deeds of the body of ſin. For that, for which God promiſeth his ſpirit to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for that he giveth it to them, yea, and it doth work powerfully in the Saints of God this way, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. laſt, <hi>neither will I bide my face any more from them, for I have poured out my ſpirit upon the bouſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith the Lord God;</hi> Gods hiding his face, is for fins unmortified, therefore when he ſaith, I will not hide my face from them, for I have poured out my ſpirit upon them, this is ſignified, I have given them my ſpirit to ſubdue their ſins, and it ſhall ſubdue them, and ſo I will not hide my face any more (as heretofore) from them; and from theſe things it follows that it is the work and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſpirit, it's part of its office, to help the people of God, in ſlaying their luſts, the ſpirit
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97673:61"/>hath undertaken to be our helper therein, that work for which God hath promiſed and given his ſpirit to us, that work it hath undertaken, and is engaged to help us in the doing of;</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We honour the ſpirit when we give our ſelves through it to mortifie out corruptions, as it is an honour to the ſpirit, that it is promiſed and given to help us in this work, ſo do we honour it, when accordingly we make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>But if we ſeek the deſtruction of our ſins, and not through the ſpirit, then do we highly diſhonour it, we put it out of office; As if any ſhall think to ſatisfie for their ſins, they greatly diſhonour Chriſt, ſo if any think to mortifie their ſins of themſelves, this is a high diſhonour to the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Q. 3. <hi>How are the deeds of the body of ſin to be mortified through the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. This is to be done through the help, by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, As that good that is in men is frequently mortified through the evil Spirit, through him the Image of God was mortified in our firſt Parents, ſo (though with a difference) that evil that is in Gods choſen is mortified through the good Spirit. There are two things I ſhall ſpeak to, in anſwering this enquiry. 1. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, what it is that the Spirit doth in helping us to mortifie our ſins. 2. What we are to do that we may have the help of the Spirit in this work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is it that the Spirit doth in enabling us to mortifie the deeds of the body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. The Spirit of God doth ſhew a ſoul its ſin, we are naturally exceeding unwilling to behold our iniquities, and we are very blind at home, more apt are we (as our Lord teacheth us) <hi>to ſee a more in our Brothers,</hi> than to perceive, or be ſenſible of a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97673:61"/>
                  <hi>beam in our own eye,</hi> many of our evils lye quite out of our ſight, though great and heinous, as <hi>Saul</hi>'s perſecuting Chriſt, till he was convinc'd thereof from Heaven (as himſelf ſaith) <hi>he verily thought he ought to do what he did,</hi> ſo naturally men ſin fouly and think they ought to do as they do, or they ſee no evil therein; hence thoſe ſpeeches, what hurt is there in this, and what hurt is there in that? and as for thoſe ſins, we do ſee we have naturally a weak and ſlight ſight of them, we do'nt think them to be ſo evil as indeed they are, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Where is my fear ſaith the Lord of hoſts unto you O Prieſts, that deſpiſe my Name; and ye ſay wherein have we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed thy Name?</hi> ch. 2.17. <hi>Ye have wearied the Lord with your words; yet ye ſay wherein have we wearied him?</hi> Chap. 3.13. <hi>Your words have been ſtout againſt me, ſaith the Lord; Yet ye ſay, what have we ſpoken ſo much againſt thee?</hi> Some ſins they denyed quite, and others they denyed in part, though they had ſpoken, yet not ſo much againſt the Lord, as an Antient ſaith, men uſe to deny and excuſe their ſin, ſaying, I have not done it, or if I have done it, I have not done ill, or if ill, not very ill, or if very ill, not with an ill intention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore (a ſight of ſin being neceſſary to the death of ſin) the Spirit comes and openeth the eyes of our underſtandings, ſets our tranſgreſſions before us, points (as it were) to this and that ſin, and holds our thoughts upon it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all things even the deep things of God,</hi> ſo it ſearcheth the deep things of our hearts, diſcovering our ſecret evils to us, as hereafter, <hi>all the hidden things of darkneſs ſhall be brought to light, and in that day, the councels of the hearts ſhall be made manifeſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. So now, when the Spirit gives its aſſiſtance to any in deſtroying
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97673:62"/>their ſins, it doth bring to light unto them thoſe luſtings that were ſecret to them before, it doth make manifeſt to them the evil councels of their heart, it declares and makes evident to them their ſecret purpoſes, deſires, and the other hidden workings of ſin in them, the Spirit evidenceth both that they are guilty of ſuch ſins, and it reveals the ſinfulneſs of them, cauſing the ſoul to view them, till it be ſoundly convinced, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. when the Spirit comes, it <hi>reproves, or convinceth the world of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit doth bow our wills, and make us ſincerely willing to have our ſins ſubdued, no man by nature hath a true will to this, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his ſin, hence ſuch ado in men to ſave their ſins, when they are told of them, or the word meets with them, never did any one ſeek ſo or more induſtriouſly to ſave the neareſt relation, the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friend as a natural man his ſin, by uſing all cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hide it, by denying it, or cloaking and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing it, as a man at Cudgels ſeeks to ſave his head, ſo doth a natural man to ſave his ſin; But when the ſpirit comes, then it makes the ſoul will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have its luſts ſlain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0.2, 3. <hi>Rule thou in the mid'ſt of thine enemies, thy people ſhall be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the day of thy power,</hi> willing to what? willing to this that Chriſt ſhould rule in the midſt of his enemies in their ſouls, ſo as to beat them down, and deſtroy them as he pleaſeth. Naturally men defend their luſts as the <hi>Benjamits</hi> thoſe filthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who raviſhed the <hi>Levit</hi>'s Concubine, but when the ſpirit comes, and deals with the ſoul, (as that woman with the men of <hi>Abel,</hi> 2 Sam. 20.22. <hi>who by her wiſdom perſwaded them to cut off the head of</hi> Sheba <hi>the Son of</hi> Bichri, <hi>who rebelled againſt</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and to caſt it out to</hi> Joab, ſo) then is the ſoul
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97673:62"/>willing, yea, it deſires and by all means ſeeks to have the head of every luſt cut off, it being an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Chriſt the Son of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſpirit doth help our infirmities in prayer, by ſighs and groans which cannot be uttered (as the Apoſtle ſaith ſome verſes after my Text) it cauſeth us to ſigh becauſe ſin is in us, and ſo works in us, and to groan to the Lord to be delivered from the bondage of this, and that corruption; till the ſpirit comes, a man rather ſighs, when his ſin is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and reproved, he groans when he is ſtopt in the fulfilling of his luſts, but if the ſpirit once begin to work thorowly, then the man ſighs to be rid of his ſin, and groaneth becauſe he is ſo led captive by it, it was by the ſpirit that the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death,</hi> None can ſay ſo, as he did, but by the ſpirit, and when any are enabled ſo to ſay, ſighingly and groaningly as he, then doth the Lord hear, and help, as he did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> againſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 2.23, 24. <hi>the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſighed by reaſon of the bondage, and they cryed, and their cry came up unto God, by reaſon of the bondage. and God heard their groaning, and God remembred his Covenant, and God looked upon the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and God had reſpect unto them,</hi> ſo God hears much more, groanings becauſe of ſpiritual bondage, and the cry of ſouls wreſtling againſt their luſts, comes up to him, and God looks with an eye of pity on ſuch, and hath reſpect to them, and ſo comes their deliverance, by the death of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> their corruptions, through the hand of Chriſt (tipyfied by <hi>Moſes</hi>) and their ſins not only in the guilt, but alſo in the power of them are deſtroyed in the red ſea, by the virtue of the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:97673:63"/>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſpirit cauſeth and enables the ſoul to hearken and liſten to the Word of God, when it reads, or hears, or thinks thereof, and it makes a ſuitable application of truths to the ſoul, according as it knows is beſt and moſt proper for it, ſo that a man looks upon, and takes this or that word as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him, as ſpoken to him, with reſpect to his ſin; we are very ſubject to paſs over the truths of God ſlightly, and to put them off, as not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or ſpoken to us, but the ſpirit <hi>opens the heart</hi> (as we read it did <hi>Lydia</hi>'s) it cauſeth the ſoul to hear, and to hear diligently for it ſelf, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch and ſuch words to it's own caſe, and its own corruptions; ſuch a threatning belongs to me, and will ſurely be executed upon me, if ſuch a ſin ſtill live in me and have dominion over me, ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to me, and will be fulfilled to me if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; theſe and theſe ſins crucified Chriſt, he bare them, they lay as a heavy weight upon him, they joyned with other, to ſqueeze, to preſs out the very heart bloud of Chriſt, and the like, thus ſaith the ſoul by the ſpirit, when the ſpirit helps it in morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying its ſins; the ſoul doth Preach to it ſelf, argue and plead with it ſelf in order to the ſlaying, leaving and caſting away its ſins.</p>
               <p>And becauſe we are very apt to forget things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially then, when the remembrance of them is moſt needful, when ſin is ſtirring in us, therefore the ſpirit ſtrengthens our memory, or helps it, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things formerly read and heard to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, ſeaſonably, when we moſt need them, when Iuſt prevails in us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>the Holy Ghoſt whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, For as much as believing is very neceſſary
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97673:63"/>to the ſubduing our ſins, this is our victory (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>) even our faith, therefore the ſpirit helps us in overcoming our ſins, by working in us a <hi>ſpirit of faith,</hi> by ſtirring up faith in us, and cauſing us to act faith on the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>by whoſe ſtripes</hi> (as we read) <hi>we are healed;</hi> as our bodies are healed by the deſtroying our diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſo our ſouls by the mortifying our ſins, which is by the vertue of Chriſt's ſtripes, but not without faith acted thereon, therefore the ſpirit helps in this, and alſo in acting faith on the ſeveral truths of Scripture, to believe what the Scripture ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſins themſelves and the fruit of them, what will follow if they dye not, to believe the threatnings, and the promiſes, which is a ſpecial means to deſtroy ſin, eſpecially faith acted on the promiſes, for by the promiſes we <hi>eſcape the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in the world through luſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. and hence that exhortation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>having theſe promiſes let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. but the promiſes unleſs mixt with faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit not.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the ſpirit doth in a ſecret way, powerfully, by the Word ſmite and wound our ſins, as with a ſword, for <hi>the word is the ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> Eph. 6.17. as a man in fight takes up his ſword, puts to his ſtrength, and layes on upon his enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſo the ſpirit takes the word, or accompanyeth it: and puts to its own power ſmiting our luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, hence we read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>the word of God is quick and powerful, ſharper than any two edged ſword,</hi> not that the bare word written, or ſpoken, is ſo in it ſelf alone; it hath no life, nor power, nor edge without the ſpirit, or it can do no execution without it, but the ſpirit makes it effectual, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110.4, 5. <hi>the Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike through
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97673:64"/>Kings,</hi> ſo the Spirit when it pleaſeth, ſtrikes through our King-like luſts that have had dominion over us; and thus it doth by it's own ſword, the word; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is to our ſins <hi>a Spirit of judgment and a Spirit of burning,</hi> as it's called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4. as a Judg to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, yea and as Executioner too, as fire to fuell, ſo is the Spirit in it's working with the Word to our Luſts. As it's ſaid in another ſenſe, <hi>I have ſlain them by my Prophets, and hewn them with the word of my mouth,</hi> ſo the Spirit by Scripture words ſlayes, hacks and hews our ſins, as <hi>Antichriſt is conſumed by the breath of the Lords mouth,</hi> ſo is ſin within us, which is the worſt Antichriſt of all, and but for which there had been no Antichriſt at all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Spirit mortifieth our ſins by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and begetting <hi>fruits in us contrary</hi> thereto, ſuch as thoſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. the Apoſtle in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes declares what are the fruits of the Fleſh, &amp; thereupon makes mention of the fruits of the Spirit, ſuch as <hi>love, peace, long-ſuffering, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs,</hi> whereby he teacheth us, that the Spirit by cauſing theſe good things in us, doth expell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, the <hi>fruits of the Eleſh</hi> which are contrary thereto, and there is one fruit of the ſpirit not there mentioned (but implyed in love) which the ſpirit works, whereby the power and life of Sin is greatly abated, yea even taken away according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurc and ſtrength of it, and that's hatred, hatred of all Sin, which makes us eager in ſeeking the utter extirpation of it out of our Souls.</p>
               <p>I might have added, The Spirit breaks the force of Satan's temptations, who ſeeks to defend Sin, and keeps it upon the throne in us, and therefore tempts violently, ſtirs up and doth all he can to kindle it and feed it, by pouring in ſuch and ſuch thoughts, as by other means, but the Spirit oppoſeth and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97673:64"/>him, to which that may be applyed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.19. <hi>When the enemy ſhall come in like a floud, the Spirit of the Lord ſhal lift up a Standard againſt him.</hi> The Spirit well underſtands all Satans <hi>wiles,</hi> and what correſpondence he hath with Sin in us, and the Spirit either driveth him away and makes him flee from us, or counterworks him, dictating anſwers to all his temptations, and as caſting water on the fire which Satan endeavours to blow up in us.</p>
            </div>

               <p>I Am now in the ſecond place to ſhew what we are to do, that we may have the help of the Spirit in mortifying the deeds of the body. For anſwer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, briefly in a few particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt receive the Spirit, we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing this way through the Spirit unleſs it be in us, dwelling and abiding in our Souls, which it will not be except it be received by us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God.</hi> So have all we who truly believe; and they who have not muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, or never will they give any of their ſins a deadly wound through it. If any keep their hearts ſhur againſt the Spirit, they cannot have the help of it, in the work of mortification, or any other work to their Salvation. As till the Soul come into the Body and dwell in it, the Body doth not, cannot work, act, or do any thing by it; ſo till the Spirit come into the Soul, and be received to dwell there, the Soul doth nothing by it to the ſubduing it's luſts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They who have received the Spirit, muſt call in, or call for it's help and aſſiſtance; when you
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97673:65"/>find corruption ſtirring, when you go about the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your ſins, you muſt deſire and ask the Spirit's co-working with you; O that the Spirit of the Lord may now work with me! O that it may now aſſiſt me! let it now pleaſe to help me, in deſtroying this evill affection, in mortifying this and that ſinfull motion, I feel ſtirring in me! You muſt never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing without looking for, and ſeeking the Spirit's aſſiſtance, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Thy Spirit is good,</hi> (it's a good guide) <hi>lead me into the Land of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> by it O Lord! be pleaſed to lead me in the good and upright way, in the ſtrait path, the way ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, till I ſhall come to that place appointed for upright ones, and where nothing of hypocriſie is, but all uprightneſs, and ſincerity only grows. So you ſhould pray, Lord! thy Spirit is holy, and mighty, it is every way able to help me, O let it aſſiſt me in mortifying mine iniquities, till they ſhall be all deſtroyed, till I come to that Country, where no ſuch poyſonous, &amp; hurtful thing as ſin, doth grow, or live, or hath any being.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You muſt wholly rely on and truſt in the Spirit for its direction, and powerfull co-operation with you in this work, not having any thought as if you could put to death, or do any thing for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of any ſin of your ſelves; but knowing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring and acknowledging alſo, your own utter weakneſs, and inſufficiency; your truſt, confidence &amp; relyance muſt be altogether on the Spirit. As <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat</hi> ſaid, <hi>We know not what to do, but our eyes are to thee,</hi> which implyes truſt and dependance on God; ſo your eyes muſt be to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.19. <hi>Mine enemies are lively, and they are ſtrong,</hi> i. e. they are too ſtrong for me, what then? <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>In thee O Lord do I hope.</hi> So when our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enemies are lively, and when they are (as indeed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97673:65"/>they alwayes are) too ſtrong for us, we muſt hope in the Spirit of God, for ſtrength from it. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 47.3. <hi>He ſhall ſubdue the People under us; and the Nations under our feet,</hi> we will not think or attempt it in our own ſtrength, but as elſewhere it is, <hi>In the name of the Lord I will deſtroy them, yea in the Lords name will I destroy them: I will not truſt in my bow, nor ſhall my ſword ſave me,</hi> &amp;c. So we muſt not think that any means we can uſe, can lay dead any ſin, but we muſt ſtill purpoſe, reſolve and endeavour the ſlaying of every ſin, in the power and ſtrength of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, You muſt lye in the way of the Spirits working, as Marriners do lay their Veſſell in the way of the wind, or the Miller turns his Mill that way the wind blows, becauſe the Ship will not ſail, nor the Mill grind without the wind, So you muſt lay your ſelves in the way of the Spirits breathing, and turn your Souls to that bleſſed wind, that way it bloweth. I mean you muſt attend under Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, you muſt give your ſelves to religious holy duties, to hear, to read, to meditate on the Word of God, to confer with others, and joyn in prayer with them as you have opportunity, <hi>&amp;c. John</hi> 3.8. The Spirit worketh, <hi>As the wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> not where we liſt, but where it ſelf pleaſeth, and where is it, that the Spirit liſteth to work? ſure it is in the way of it's own appointments.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, We muſt yeild up our ſelves to the Spirit, to be acted, moved and ruled according to it's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as Souldiers, follow your Leader, obſerve his Commands, yea every beck or wagging of his head, or hand, and accordingly order themſelves, ſo we muſt well mind all the dictates, take notice of all the movings of the Spirit in us, and comply there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>This I ſay then, walk in the Spirit, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97673:66"/>ye ſhall not fulfill the luſt of the fleſh;</hi> So ſay I, yeild to the Spirit, to along with it, ſo ſhal ye mortifie any deed of the Fleſh. If the Spirit go one way &amp; you will go another, if the Spirit call and you'l not hearken, if that ſpeak and you'l not hear, if that move and you'l not follow the motions thereof, then will the Spirit leave you to your ſelves.</p>
               <p>See the V. following my Text, the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid, if ye through the ſpirit mortifie the deeds of the Body, he adds in the next words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,</hi> whereby he teacheth us, that if we would mortifie the deeds of the Body through the ſpirit, then we muſt be led by the ſpirit, we muſt reſign our ſelves to the conduct and guidance thereof.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, We muſt wait on the ſpirit, if it doe not come in to our aſſiſtance, if it do not help us as we deſire, we muſt continue waiting, hold on looking for it, begging it, and uſing the means it hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. As they waited at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> for the moving of the waters by the Angel that they might be healed. If the Angel came not and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the waters one day, nor the next; yea, though he ſtayed one week, and another, ſtill they waited there, till he ſhould come. When <hi>Saul</hi> waited not for <hi>Samuel, Samuel</hi> told him he did fooliſhly, and he ſhould loſe his Kingdome. So do they exceeding fooliſhly who wait not for the ſpirit of God, and hence it is that many loſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and never get victory over their corruption, becauſe they will not continue waiting till the ſpirit come in to their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſix things we are to do, that we may mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our ſins through the ſpirit, but it is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that neither can any of theſe be done without the ſpirit, therefore we muſt ask it, that we by it,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97673:66"/>may be enabled to do theſe things. Yet muſt we not ſit ſtill, but we muſt put forth our ſelves, ſtir up our ſelves, and go as far as we can, as well as we can.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be well noted, The Apoſtle ſaith not, If the ſpirit do mortifie the deeds of the body in you, but if ye through the ſpirit do mortifie them; plainly declaring and teſtifying to us, that though we can do nothing of our ſelves that ſhall be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, we muſt not be idle, we muſt not ſit ſtill, but we muſt rouze up our ſelves, and as the little child that can't go alone, yet ſtrives to go, when lead, it moves it's leggs, and doth what it can towards it's going; ſo muſt we do to the utmoſt what lyes in us, towards the mortification of our ſins, and ſo look for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to carry us on in the work proſperouſly.</p>

Learn by the Truth to underſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right the councels, exhortations, and commands of Scripture, this and that the Scripture ſaith you muſt do, and you are oft call'd upon to do ſuch things from the Word of God; but how is it that you are to do them? Remember alwayes, though this be not every where, or every time expreſt, this is meant, this is alwayes underſtood, you muſt do ſo and ſo through the ſpirit, you muſt get the ſpirit, and give up your ſelves to the ſpirit, that you may do all and every of the things whereto you are counſelled, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, or commanded. For this work of mortifying our ſins is a generall work that hath an influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to even all other things that concern us to do, or whereto we are obliged in our whole converſation; nothing can be done as God requireth if this be not done; every command of God implyes the ſubduing of ſome luſt or other, even luſt being contrary to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97673:67"/>ſome command. If then we are to mortifie our ſins through the ſpirit, through it therefore we are to yeild obedience to all the commands of the Lord.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Learn whence it is that the purpoſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and endeavours of men againſt their ſin, are ſo fruitleſſe and ineffectuall, how oft is it that men purpoſe, reſolve and take great pains to bring under this or that luſt in them? yet it retains it's ſtrength, yet it continueth your maſter notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Why? whence is this? It is becauſe they have not learnt to put themſelves into the hand of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to take that along with them in what they do. They reſolve but not through the ſpirit; they ſtrive, they weep, but they truſt in themſelves, they call not for, their eye is not to the ſpirit of God; ſo all their reſolutions vaniſh &amp; wither away, all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, pains, and induſtry prove abortive and in vain. As it's ſaid concerning prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.2.3. <hi>Ye luſt, and have not; ye kill &amp; deſire to have and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain; ye fight and war, yet ye have not, becauſe ye ask not; ye ask and receive not becauſe ye ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe:</hi> ſo many do much, they make a great deal of ſtir about the conquering their corruptions; yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not, becauſe they do all amiſſe; &amp; as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Many ſhal ſtrive to enter &amp; ſhal not be able,</hi> ſo many ſtrive to deſtroy their ſin but are not able, becauſe they have not learnt to go forth againſt their evill motions under the conduct, and in the power of the Holy Ghoſt. Hath it not been thus, ſometimes with you? Such a ſin you have found working ſtrongly in you, &amp; you have made war upon it, ſought it's death, reſolved upon it's deſtruction; but to no purpoſe? It hath continued ſtill living, lively &amp; ſtirring as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; learn then this day, &amp; learn it well, what hath been the cauſe, even this, know this to have been the reaſon; you have not taken the right courſe, you have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97673:67"/>not duly ſought, &amp; therefore have not truly had the ſpirit helping you, which only hath power to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and skill to direct you in that you have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured. As the Apoſtle ſaith, the ſpirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, for we know not what to pray for as we ought. So the ſpirit muſt help our infirmities, or we know not in any caſe, or matter relating to the good of our ſouls what to do, as we ought. When any labour againſt their ſin without the ſpirit, they do as one that takes a great deal of pains to open a dore without the right key, or to cauſe a veſſell to ſail againſt the ſtream without any wind, in a calm. And perhaps you have obſerved that others they have got great victory over their ſins in much leſſe time; you have ſtriven long and yet are as trodden under foot by this and that baſe luſt, and another who began to look heavenward a great while after you, is able to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his ſin under his feet; How ſo? becauſe he is wiſe, and being taught by the ſpirit, hath taken the ſpirit along with him in all his endeavours; and then no wonder. As ſuppoſe two veſſels ſet forth to one Port, from ſeverall harbours, the one long after the other, having divers leagues more to ſail, yet if this veſſel have a good gale of wind, and the other be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed, and have only the ſtrength of the marriners to put it forward by Poles and Oars, you will not marvel, if that which ſet out laſt, and hath the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt way to go, be firſt at the intended haven, leaving the other behind, basking and toſſing in the waves, poſſibly till ſhe be foundred or wrackt, through a great ſtorm ariſing.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> 3. Let this cauſe you to magnifie the Goſpel, the Doctrine of Chriſt, becauſe this tells you how you ſhall ſlay your worſt, moſt hurtful, deadly and powerful enemies, and lay them dead at your feet. The Law, that diſcovers ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>I had not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97673:68"/>known ſin but by the Law, for I had not known luſt, except the Law had ſaid, thou ſhalt not covet;</hi> The Law alſo denounceth a ſore curſe to them who walk after their luſts, but the Law telleth us not of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, how we ſhall have help againſt them; it is the Goſpel that teacheth us to mortifie the deeds of ſin through the ſpirit. The meer light of nature ſaith of many ſins, they muſt be mortified, but is at a ſtand as to this, the only way for the mortification of them; hence thoſe great Moraliſts, and wiſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers who ſpeak much againſt many impieties, and give divers rules (good in their place) for the getting rid of them, yet are ſilent in this; ſome of thoſe wiſe men gave ſtrange rules for the mortifying of luſt, (as that of <hi>Crates,</hi> famiſh thy ſelf) noting that it was not feaſable, and all their precepts are ineffectual for the real deſtroying any luſt; therefore the beſt of thoſe men are noted to have lived under the dominion of ſome deſtroying corruption, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, ambition, envy, or ſuch like; They write of one <hi>Democritus</hi> he put out his eyes becauſe he could not look without luſting, but did that mortifie his ſin? No, though his eyes were out, his corruption continued ſtill within.</p>
                  <p>There are two great things only to be known by the Goſpel, the one is how we may have peace with God, be accepted of him, and juſtified in his ſight? the Goſpel only holds forth juſtifying righteouſneſs. the other is this I am now upon, how we may get our ſins deſtroyed, and ſo our hearts purified?</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. You may make uſe of this truth by way of tryal, whether you have the ſpirit of Chriſt in you or no; The greateſt queſtion in the world is, whether you are in Chriſt Jeſus, the Anſwer to that is, <hi>he that hath not the ſpirit of Chriſt</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>is none of his,</hi> but he that hath the ſpirit of Chriſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97673:68"/>in him, is in Chriſt. And if you would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſpirit of Chriſt be in you, this is one anſwer, if it be in you, it works in you, it helps and aſſiſts you; and that in mortifying your ſins. Have your ſins deadly wounds? is there any thing done really and conſiderably towards the ruining them? If ſo, then you have the ſpirit of Chriſt in you, becauſe this is to be done only through the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. Adore the Lord, and greatly praiſe him, that he is pleaſed not only to acquaint us with the neceſſity of mortifying the deeds of ſin, but alſo to direct us how we ſhall do it, and that in ſuch a way as this through his own ſpirit. God might have told us of the deſert of our ſins, the danger of living in them, and what would follow thereupon, and ſo left us to <hi>pine away in them,</hi> which had been a moſt woeful, doleful caſe. But behold, the riches of his grace, he ſhews us a way in the Goſpel both for our attaining pardon of our tranſgreſſions, and victory over all our corruptions! It may be objected, Alas what is this, that we hear, we muſt mortifie our ſins through the ſpirit, we may hear of this as many do, and yet be far enough from being freed from the power of our ſins. I anſwer, true, no doubt many hear of this, who yet continue to live after the fleſh, and ſo dye eternally, having not one of all their luſts deſtroyed. But then, it is their own fault, becauſe they follow not the Counſel of God in his Word; it is the love and goodneſs of a friend, if be tell you a ſoveraign effectual remedy for any mortal Diſeaſe under which you labour, though at length you dye thereof, becauſe you will not uſe the means he preſcribes, or directs you to. So is it the grace of God that he declares to us how our ſins may be killed, and our ſouls ſaved, though many hear thereof, and yet dye in their ſins, becauſe they take
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97673:69"/>not the good counſel given them. It may be again objected, is the ſpirit at our command? can we mortifie our ſins through it, if we will? I anſwer, Though the ſpirit be not at our command, it is at our entreaty, ſo be it we heartily ſeek it as we are directed. (which how it is, will after be ſhewn) So that this truth leaves all thoſe utterly in excuſable who ſtill live in their ſins, (after their hearing it) and it will aggravate their condemnation, in that though they heard from the Word of God how they ſhould deſtroy their luſts, they continued ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved by them, and lived under the power of them all their dayes. Yet is this Doctrine a great diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the grace of God, to all men in general to whom the Goſpel is publiſhed. Eſpecially doth this ſpeak the grace of God to you who are in Chriſt, for he hath already actually given you his ſpirit, and all that he now requireth of you is, that you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, and make uſe of it, as of a great and moſt Noble friend, who is able and ready at all times upon all occaſions to help you. Know therefore the Lord your God is full of grace towards you; He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed calls you to great work, to warring and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt your ſtrong corruptions, from which if he pleaſed he could eaſily, ſuddenly, altogether perfectly deliver you while here, as he will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; This may ſeem hard, and ſeem to ſpeak ſome want of fatherly love and kindneſs; but think not ſo, ſeeing he hath given you an all ſufficient helper, fully anſwerable to the greatneſs of the work which he puts you upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 6. Let the ſixth uſe be to convince all ſuch of great error, who think they can mortifie their ſins of themſelves, or that any thing they can do, can be effectual to the mortification thereof without the ſpirit. It is one of the grand errors of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97673:69"/>party, to think that their vows, faſtings, penance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can mortifie ſin, and they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves divers of them, to ſevere courſes, and put others on to ſuch and ſuch things, as effectual means to ſlay their luſts without looking after the ſpirit of Chriſt for it's aſſiſtance. Wherein, too too many who oppoſe Popery are too like to Papiſts, (as in other things) for are there not many who hearing the abſolute neceſſity of having their ſins ſlain, do thereupon reſolve, and ſtrive, with their eye off from the ſpirit? and how frequent is it, for ſins to be cryed down, and people to be ſtirred up, to put away, leave, forſake, and deſtroy their ſins? but as to the ſpirit's help, and mens ſeeking that, there is a deep ſilence.</p>
                  <p>It is evident that men commonly imagine there's no neceſſity of any help, or at leaſt that there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of any ſpecial help of the ſpirit in this work.</p>
                  <p>But remember you, I pray, theſe three words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such a thought is full of falſhood and deceit, very croſs to plain Scripture, exceeding contrary to the Goſpel, ſo it hath much ſin in it. 2. It's very injurious to the bleſſed ſpirit, it derogates from his honour, denyeth it that which is it's prerogative, and it affronts Chriſt who hath obtained the ſpirit to help in this work, yea it makes the promiſe of the ſpirit vain and needleſs, and ſo its full of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. 3. Such a thought is exceeding prejudicial to all in whom it hath place, for they who conceit, or imagine they can deal with their ſoul enemies without the ſpirit, are not like to have its help, nor will they look for, nor do they care for its aſſiſtance. When we ſuppoſe we can do a work that concerns us of our ſelves, we look not forth for a helper. Is it not ſaid ſometimes, I care not whether you, or he, or any one will afford me help, I'le do ſuch a thing my
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97673:70"/>ſelf, I can do it without you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O look to your own hearts, for ordinary is it, that men have truth in their heads and tongues, yet the contrary error deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſtrongly rooted in their hearts, and thriving there; As in other things ſo in this, an uſual evil is it for men to <hi>hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> they ſay they cannot mortifie any ſin without the ſpirit, yet let them but faithfully examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and they ſhall find that they do attempt to get the conqueſt of this and that ſin, and imagine that they ſhall without the ſpirit. Wherefore let the ſeventh uſe be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 7. To put you upon conſidering, whether is this Doctrine printed in your hearts, have you a ſound conviction; have you a heart perſwaſion of it, that none, no not one of your ſins, not the leaſt of your many iniquities, evil affections, and ſinful motions, not your worldlineſs, not your vanity, not your pride, not your unbelief, not any other ſin can be executed, crucified and ſlain, but by the ſpirit of the Lord. How ſhall we know (you may ſay) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our hearts are thus inſtructed, and poſſeſt by this truth? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you are thus perſwaded, then you do honour the ſpirit in your hearts, and greatly prize it, value and highly eſteem it; there is a generation who no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly ſlight the holy ſpirit, yea who ſcoff at and deride it; ſuch (ſay they jeeringly) are men of the ſpirit, all for the ſpirit; but let ſuch profane and brutiſh ones ſay what they will, you who are indeed convinced that you can get no real conqueſt over any ſin without it, you make exceeding much of it upon that account, and had much rather be men of the ſpirit, than men of eſtate and honour. Therefore the great thing you pray daily for is an abundance thereof, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>take not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97673:70"/>thy holy ſpirit from me,</hi> you pray, Lord give thy holy ſpirit to me, O continue it with me, let me be filled therewith. And when you pray againſt your ſins, you do not ask the deſtruction of them directly or not only, but you ask the ſpirit, that through it you may mortifie them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The promiſe of the ſpirit is exceeding precious to you, no promiſe more ſweet and refreſhing to your ſouls, no promiſe of forgiveneſſe delights you more than a promiſe of the holy ſpirit; every ſuch promiſe you embrace, and lay up in your hearts, as there is great reaſon why you ſhould, and that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than other promiſes, becauſe it is by the ſpirit that other promiſes are accompliſhed, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of grace are included in the promiſe of the ſpirit, they all being fulfilled thereby.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When you find you can't get any ſin under, that any luſt is too hard for you, then you not only are troubled, mourn and ſigh, by reaſon of the life and ſtrength of ſin, and your own weakneſs to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it; but alſo as much or more for want of the ſpirit, whence your weakneſs to mortifie it doth ariſe. A man not gracious, not truely enlightned may be much (upon ſome accounts) grieved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome luſt in him is ſo ſtrong and prevalent, but an ungracious man hardly comes to this, to mourn for his want of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You make much of the convictions of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; you do not ſeek to ſmother them when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth you of ſin, but you are glad of them, and cheriſh them: As you entertain a good friend whoſe company you deſire, whoſe help you need, and whom you would fain have to abide with you though he be ſomewhat free with you in telling you of ſome things he likes not: Or as wounded perſons (if they are bent to have their cure) receive with kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97673:71"/>a skilful Chyrurgion, though he open their wounds and in his work put them to pain.</p>
                  <p>So you give entertainment to the ſpirit, though it work for the cauſing you to ſee, and for the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling you for your ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 8. In the eighth place let me put you again upon the tryal whether you have learnt and do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this neceſſary counſel, do you? doth every one of you, mortifie your ſin through the ſpirit? I hope there is no one of you ſo fearleſs of the great only true God, ſo faithleſs of the word of truth, ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of his precious immortal foul, ſo mindleſs of his future eternal condition, ſo wedded to and, in league with ſin, as that he is wholly negligent in ſeeking to get it mortified. Therefore the queſtion I now put to you is, how is it that you endeavour this, is it in a right manner? is it according to the Goſpel as my Text directeth? It may be ſaid, I hope yes; but how ſhall I diſcern and prove to my ſelf, or any other if need were, that I indeed ſo do? for anſwer to that, take theſe things in ſhort. If ſo then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you have felt your need of the ſpirit, and from ſoul hunger and thirſt after it, you have gone to Jeſus Chriſt for it; he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 7.37. <hi>If any one thirſt let him come to me and drink,</hi> now you thirſting, have gone to Chriſt and drunk, received from him, this water of life, the ſpirit, which is as a water of death to the ſins of thoſe in whom it dwells, and ſo as water of life to their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you mortifie your ſins through the ſpirit, then you ſeek the mortification of them uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, and thorowly, even of all your ſins in all the workings thereof, ſo that if it might be you could wiſh, yea do deſire that nothing of them, or of any one of them might remain. The holy ſpirit is an enemy to one ſin as well as to another, and to every
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97673:71"/>degree of ſin, and all the outgoings or workings thereof: therefore he that goeth forth againſt ſin by the ſpirit, he warreth againſt all ſin one as well as another; A ſign <hi>Saul</hi> was not carried forth by the ſpirit againſt the <hi>Amalekits</hi> (as to the frame of his ſpirit) becauſe he ſpared ſome he ſhould have ſlain; ſo a ſign a man ſeeks not the death of his ſin through the ſpirit if he ſpare any luſt, evil affection or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And if the ſpirit act you, then you lay out your ſelves, will and labour to mortifie every ſin in all it's outbreaking, which way ſoever it vents it ſelf and moves. For inſtance, pride that works ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes and ſhews it ſelf by a mans habit, gate, looks, thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if you only mind to deſtroy your pride as iſſuing forth or working one or two of theſe wayes, and not all, you have reaſon to doubt whether you are acted by the ſpirit in what you do againſt your pride. So for covetouſneſs, that luſt hath many ſtreams and wayes of working, as making haſt to be rich, not giving to good and charitable uſes, buying under, and ſelling above the Market or due price, not allowing a mans ſelf or his Relations what is fitting, thirſting after gain, diſcontent becauſe a man hath or gets no more of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if you only ſeek to deſtroy your covetouſneſs as moving and acting ſome and not all theſe wayes, that ſpeaks what you do againſt ſome, is not of the ſpirit. Or if you will and ſtrive to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any ſin only in part, in ſome degree, that's a bad token, but this is a good ſign, when you are ſet againſt every ſin, in every motion, in all the wayes of its working, and leſs than its heart blood, its utter ruine will not, cannot content you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You uſe none but ſuch means as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath preſcribed for the ſlaying any luſt, you will not meddle with unlawful, ſuperſtitious means, nor
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97673:72"/>any other but ſuch as the Word of God directs to, as praying, reading, hearing, meditating, good Company, and ſuch like, for the ſpirit of God works not by unlawful means; if any do war ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually by the ſpirit, they war lawfully; whereby it appears that Papiſts, and other ſuperſtitious perſons who ſeem very ſtrict, are not led out againſt their ſins by the ſpirit, becauſe they leave the right path, and take ſtrange courſes, which God hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Yea, which he hath forbidden, ſuch a means is that, when any mew themſelves up in a Cell, or lay aſide their Calling, avoid the Society of Relations, and others with whom they ought to accompany, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I may add to this, you chiefly uſe thoſe means wherein the ſpirit principally delights, as looking to the promiſes, the ſufferings, the holy example of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It appears by the Apoſtles arguing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to what he eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially lookt, and we ought to look for the deſtroying our ſin, even the death, the crucifixion of Chriſt; which alſo may be gathered from <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid I ſhould glory in any thing ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Christ, by whom</hi> (or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, by which Croſs) <hi>I am Crucified to the world, and the world to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you mortifie the deeds of the body by the ſpirit, then this work is in a good degree facilitated and made eaſie to you, though exceeding difficult in it ſelf and grievous to the fleſh. It's eaſie for one very weak to do a great work, if he have a ſtrong able helper, it's eaſie for a young beginner to make good Letters, and write well, if his hand be guided by a skilful Maſter. So for a ſoul to beat down its luſts when it hath the powerful aſſiſtance of the Almighty moſt wiſe ſpirit. And hence they who have the ſpirit helping them, fight againſt their ſins
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97673:72"/>with delight; it being a good work, and they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good help, what they do is not burthenſom, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſom and irkſom as it is to others, therefore they are not apt to be diſcouraged, and give over as others are, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.8, 9. <hi>They conſpired all of them together to come and to fight againſt</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>nevertheleſs we made our prayer unto our God, and ſet watch againſt them day and night; Nehemiah</hi> was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned, becauſe he was acted and aſſiſted by the Spirit in the work whereto he was called; Thus when a man is ſet on work againſt ſin by the Spirit. Only that none miſtake, let two things be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Spirit of God ſeldom or never doth aſſiſt any in this life, in their combating with ſin as it can, it puts not forth all its ability to the utmoſt in helping any here, if it did, farewel all ſin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; but becauſe it's the will of God we ſhould ſtill be kept in exerciſe in this world, and fight it through all the way to heaven, therefore the Spirit of God helps thoſe who have its help only in ſome degree ſo far as it pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Spirit ſtrengthens ſome more, others leſs, and the ſame perſons ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, ſometimes the Spirit almoſt quite leaves thoſe who have it and are acted by it, as to their ſenſe they are even altogether left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, either becauſe they have grieved the Spirit, or for their tryal, and to cauſe them to know more their own weakneſs, and pray more earneſtly for the Spirits help. Hence it may be that they who have the Spirit and have gone far in the war againſt their ſin by it, may find the work ſo hard as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin for a time to ſink under it. As <hi>Moſes</hi> though in governing the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> he was mightily ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Spirit, yet once we read, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.9. he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97673:73"/>complained of the burden of his work and ſaid he was <hi>not able to bear it.</hi> But it is not ordinarily, or uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thus, for the moſt part they who have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with them go forward couragiouſly and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and thus is it ſtill ſo far as the Spirit doth lead and carry them in what they do.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If you mortifie your ſins by the Spirit, then as really as you endeavour the death of any ſin, you do labour to exerciſe that grace that's contrary thereto, every luſt hath a grace oppoſite to it, he that mortifies his luſt by the Spirit, doth alſo quicken his grace that ſtands in oppoſition to it, for the Spirit is as great a friend to grace, as it is an enemy to ſin, and by ſtirring up grace in us (as was formerly ſaid) the Spirit doth help us in beating down our ſin, if then the Spirit help you to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie envie and malice, it doth put you on to exerciſe charity, kindneſs, and mercy. If it aſſiſt you againſt coverouſneſs, it doth enable you to exerciſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs, and thus as to other things. Therefore they hardly have the Spirit (in a ſpecial ſaving way at leaſt) working with them, who only ſeek to get ſin down, but mind not to get grace up.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, This is a ſure rule, whatever the Spirit helps us to do, it cauſeth us to do from a gracious principle to a gracious end, ſo in the preſent caſe, if the Spirit ſtir up any to mortifie their ſins, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to endeavour the death thereof from a principle of hatred of ſin, love to God, and faith of his Word; and if the Spirit work with us, it cauſeth us to ſtrive to ruine ſin, not only as contrary to us, but as contrary to the law, nature, and name of God, and honour of Chriſt. Whoever aims only at himſelf in what he doth, he acts from and of himſelf, and is not acted by the Spirit. For though the Spirit love all in whom it is, it loves God more, and Chriſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97673:73"/>more than it loves us. Though the Spirit aims at our good, yet more at the honour of God &amp; Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Though the Spirit, if you are acted by it, do put you on to purſue all your ſins to death, yet ſome of them principally, as, the more ſtrongly and lively any ſin is, the more it ſteals or keeps the heart from God, the more it hinders you in religious ſervices, the more hurt it cauſeth you to do to others by offending, by hardning, and cauſing them to ſtumble, and whatever ſin it be by which Gods name, your profeſſion and your ſouls moſt ſuffer, that you eſpecially ſtrike at, and war upon; chiefly your chief ſin, your iniquity, your maſter corruption, which is in you the worſt; for the Spirit of God is a Spirit of wiſdom; and when it affords its aſſiſtance it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to true wiſdom. Therefore it ſpake <hi>Saul</hi> to be acted by his own Spirit in that he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> the chief of the <hi>Amalekits</hi> againſt whom God ſent him, whereas of all other, he ſhould have put him to death, ſo when any indulge and are tender to their head ſin, that which ſits upon the throne in them which above all ſhould be mortified.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, If you have the Spirits aſſiſtance, then you do ordinarily mortifie your ſinful motions under ſtrong temptations, as well as under weak, for all things are alike to the Spirit, whoſe power and whoſe underſtanding are infinite. Strong and weak temptations differ as to us, not as to the Spirit, therefore when it vouchſafeth its aſſiſting preſence, it doth help under and againſt all ſorts and kinds of temptations. It may be objected, hath it not been known and do we not read, that the beſt men under very ſtrong temptations do greatly miſcarry? For anſwer to that, it's true, but it's alſo true that even they who have the Spirit of God do ſometimes turn out of the way under weak temptations, (God ſo
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97673:74"/>ordering it that they may the better know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and be the more humbled) yea it is known that they who ſtand out againſt very mighty temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, are for a time born down by ſome that are of no great ſtrength, compared with thoſe which they withſtand. <hi>David</hi>'s temptation to take away the life of <hi>Shimei</hi> (who curſed him, flung ſtones at him then when he was King and had reigned long, his Servants alſo preſſing him to let them go and take off the head of that dead Dog) ſeems much ſtronger, than his temptation to cut off <hi>Nabal</hi> and all the males of his houſe, becauſe he refuſed to ſhew him kindneſs; yet <hi>David</hi> abſolutely refuſed to give way that <hi>Shimei</hi> ſhould be medled with, whereas he vowed the death of <hi>Nabal,</hi> and of all the men of his houſe, and armed himſelf and march'd forth to execute his purpoſe againſt him, which he had done, had he not been ſtopt as himſelf confeſſeth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.34. <hi>In very deed, as the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou had'ſt haſted and come to meet me, ſurely there had not been left unto</hi> Nabal <hi>by the morning light, any that piſſeth againſt the wall.</hi> So then, it is not barely the greatneſs of the temptation that makes a good man to ſtumble, but the withdrawing of the Spirit at ſuch a time, and then whether the temptation be ſmall or great, he is carried away thereby. Wherefore, I ſay, if the Spirit of God be in you and work with you, for the moſt part you mortifie the motions of ſin under all kinds of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; as you uſually ſtand out againſt ſmall, ſo uſually againſt great temptations alſo.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, You aſcribe all that victory that at any time you gain againſt any ſin, to the Spirit, if you are acted by it, for when the Spirit helps, it makes the ſoul ſenſible that it could not do, what it doth,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97673:74"/>of it ſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.49. <hi>He that is mighty hath done for me great things, and holy is his name,</hi> ſo ſaith the ſoul that is in a truely gracious frame and is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth againſt ſin by the Spirit; Not I have done great things to the curbing, quelling, and killing my ſins, but he that's mighty, the mighty Spirit of God, hath done great things in me, for me, and by me, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. <hi>he hath wrought all our works in us,</hi> not we our ſelves of our ſelves, but he, yea, he hath wrought not ſome, but all our works in us.</p>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 9. SEe how great need they have to ſeek the Spirit who have it not, ſo neceſſary as the mortifying any ſin is, ſo neceſſary is the having of the Spirit, for (as hath been ſaid) we muſt have the Spirit e're we can do any thing by it to the ſlaying our ſins, therefore ſo many luſts, ſo many evil affections and motions, ſo many ſins, as are in any one of us, ſo many engagements to ſeek the Spirit, without which not one of them can be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; They who have not the Spirit of the Lord, they do, they will walk after their luſts, nor can they walk otherwiſe, <hi>Jude.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>Beloved, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ye the words that were ſpoken before of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of our Lord Jeſus, how that they told you, there ſhould be mockers in the laſt time, who ſhould walk after their own ungodly luſts,</hi> how ſo? <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>theſe be they who ſeparate themſelves</hi> (i. e. from ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from the Societies of Saints) <hi>ſenſual, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirit;</hi> hence they did, they could not but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97673:75"/>walk after their luſts, becauſe though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended high, as if they had the ſpirit, and that in a larger meaſure than others, yet in truth they had it not. Whoever are without the Spirit, are in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be the Spirit of Chriſt dwell in you,</hi> but (which is implyed) if the Spirit of Chriſt dwell not in you, then are you in the fleſh; in the hands, under the power of corrupt nature, therefore cannot poſſibly mortifie the deeds of the fleſh. But get the Spirit once, ſo ſhall you (through it) be able to bring under, and tread under your feet every ſin that is in you. <hi>God is able,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to cauſe all grace to abound towards you,</hi> ſo the Spirit of God is able to cauſe all ſin to decay, wither and dye in you, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15.14. <hi>When</hi> Samſon <hi>came to</hi> Lehi <hi>the Philiſtines ſhouted againſt him, and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms, became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his hands looſed from off his hands.</hi> Thus, when the Spirit comes into any ſoul and works mightily in it, all its luſts are as nothing, of no ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, whoever yet hath not the Spirit, let ſuch a one be perſwaded to look out for it with all earneſtneſs and diligence to ſeek it, ſhould you (not having the Spirit) ſet your ſelves to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your ſins, this (as ſo) would not be obedience to God, nor pleaſing to him, becauſe he requires you to do this work through the Spirit, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to get the Spirit that you may do it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who have not, and ſeek not the Spirit, do not obey nor pleaſe God by the things they do againſt their ſins; yea, they diſobey God and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend him, in that they take not his Counſel, that holds true in this caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.1. <hi>Wo to the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97673:75"/>rebellious children</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel but not of me, and that cover with a covering but not of my ſpirit, that they may add ſin to ſin,</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God, it is adding ſin to ſin, when men think to help and ſave themſelves outwardly, much more, when any think to ſave themſelves ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually from their ſins without the ſpirit, ſuch do bring a heavy wo upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>Q. What then ſhould one do, that hath not the ſpirit that he may attain?</p>
               <p>A. 1. It is a good ſtep for one that hath not the ſpirit to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> convinc't that he is without it, and that he ſtands in a moſt abſolute neceſſity of it, ſo that he is utterly and eternally undone if he have it not. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, void, empty of the ſpirit dream and ſtrongly fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie that they have it, yea many times when men are filled and acted by the evill lying ſpirit, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry big with a vain conceit, that they have much, an eminent meaſure, of the holy ſpirit of truth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.24. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> (a man filled with the lying ſpirit) <hi>went to the good Prophet, and ſmote him on the cheek,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Which way went the ſpirit of the Lord from me to ſpeak unto thee,</hi> he verily ſuppoſed himſelf to have and to be moved by the good ſpirit of God, and he ſeems to ſpeak as if he only had it, ſo that none could have it but from him, or at leaſt that he had it firſt, <hi>Which way</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>went the ſpirit of the Lord from me to ſpeak unto thee,</hi> Which he ſpake ſcoffingly, deriding the holy Prophet, even thus are men oft moſt wofully deluded, a ſtrong perſwaſion have they, that Gods ſpirit is in them, whereas the truth is, the evill ſpirit, not the good rules and works in them. Others they have no ſenſe, feeling or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their need of the ſpirit, ſo they have no deſire after it, hence they continue without, and while it is ſo with any, they are not like to become
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97673:76"/>partakers of it, labour then to know your want, and to feell your need of the ſpirit, in order to your ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attaining it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The great thing of all to be done for the gaining of the ſpirit, is believing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. the promiſe of the ſpirit, is received through faith, there muſt be a heart receiving the Goſpel, and Jeſus Chriſt held forth thereby, there muſt be a ſoul ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led perſwaſion of the undoubted certainty of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſt, and a ſoul truſt and reſt on him, to the receiving the promiſe of the ſpirit, a right to that great promiſe, and the fulfilling thereof. That is a famous promiſe divers times repeated, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Behold, I lay in</hi> Zion <hi>a chief corner-ſtone, elect, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>and he that believeth on him ſhall not be confounded,</hi> by what ſhall he not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded? Not by any thing; not by Satan, not by ſin in it's guilt or power, not by any luſt. But how ſo? For, as he that believeth in Chriſt is cloathed with his righteouſneſſe, ſo he is made partaker of his ſpirit. Put then thy truſt in Chriſt Jeſus, faſten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by faith, and that for this end that thou mayeſt through and from him receive the ſpirit. For theſe two things, Chriſt is to be believed in, for his righteouſneſſe to juſtifie us in the ſight of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the juſtice of God, and for his ſpirit to mortifie our ſins &amp; ſo to ſanctifie our ſouls, &amp; whoever beilev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, in good earneſt, and in truth for theſe things, but they received them their perſons are clothed with his moſt perfect righteouſneſſe, their ſouls are endowed with his moſt holy bleſſed ſpirit. <hi>Rev</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>I looked and behold a dore was opened in heaven, and the firſt voice that I heard, was as the voice of a trumpet, talking with me, which ſaid come up hither, and immediately I was in the ſpirit,</hi> So when a ſoul doth hear the voice of God in the Goſpel
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97673:76"/>powerfully and effectually, ſaying, come up hither in thy heart, come to Chriſt in Heaven by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty faith, then the ſoul obeying this voice immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath the ſpirit from Chriſt communicated to it. There ſhould be alſo a believing in particular the promiſes which God hath made of giving the ſpirit, who ever embraceth by true faith any promiſe of the ſpirit as made in Chriſt, he receiveth the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that promiſe by Chriſt, Chriſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, beſtoweth the ſpirit upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, None receive the ſpirit to dwell in them without turning from their evill wayes, for there is no true faith, without a heart turn from known ſin, and while any give up or yeild themſelves to ſin, they do vex the ſpirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>They rebelled and vexed his holy ſpirit,</hi> But who is like to receive the ſpirit to dwell in him, while he rebells and vexeth it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that word is to be remembred, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Turn ye at my reproof, Behold, I will pour out my ſpirit unto you.</hi> Then I'le pour out my ſpirit unto you, when you have a heart to turn: till this be, a man is a down right enemy to the ſpirit, his heart is lock't and barr'd up againſt it, who will go and dwell in the houſe of an enemy, while he continues in open hoſtility againſt him? A man muſt lay down arms, and not maintain fight againſt him whom he needs, and deſires to come and dwell with him, and if his deſire be right he will do ſo. A man cannot truly will to receive the ſpirit, unleſſe he will to leave his ſin,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That ſweet word of Chriſt ſhould be thought on, <hi>Luke</hi> 11, 13. <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy ſpirit to them that ask him?</hi> If asking follow or go along with believing and turning, it's then ſure to prevail, receiving will be the fruit of ſuch asking. So then, the Scripture is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97673:77"/>full and plain in declaring how you may attain the ſpirit, what you ſhould do that you may gain it. Which things though (it's granted) they cannot be done without the ſpirit, yet are they not ſpoken in vain; To all whom God intends to ſave, he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth a heart to hearken to theſe counſels, and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords them the indwelling and conſtant aſſiſtance of his ſpirit while they live, (though it work not always alike in them. Therefore my advice is to any one ſenſible of his need of the ſpirit and deſirous of it, that he would take thoſe Scriptures mentioned, and ſpread them before the Lord, and hold on ſo doing, till he feel the power of his ſpirit, and be made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the influence of his grace in his heart. O Lord, gracious God who delighteſt in mercy, who art a God hearing prayer, thy word ſaith, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the ſpirit, is received through faith, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed I pray thee to give me faith, for it is thy gift. Thy word ſaith, turn at my reproof and I will pour my ſpirit out unto you; I beſeech thee turn me and I ſhall be turned, for turning is thy work; thy word ſaith, to them that ask thou wilt give thy holy ſpirit, O cauſe me to ask as I ought, open my mouth and my heart, that I may ſo ask as to receive according to thy word, for none call upon thee in truth unleſſe thou beeſt pleaſed to quicken them thereunto. Did ever any ſoul think you do thus, and continue ſo to do in uprightneſſe, who was denied? No verily, the Lord our God, is a God full of compaſſion, he will not let any one that ſincerely waits at the dore of his mercy, periſh for want of living water, his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Is not God more mercifull than you are? would you let any one (though an enemy) ly and ſtarve and periſh at your dore, if he ſhould (throwing down his arms) come and lay himſelf at your threſhhold, crying for a draught of water? or put caſe a man
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97673:77"/>through diſtemper, phrenſy, or madneſs, ſhould have done you much hurt, if he at a time coming to himſelf a little, ſhould entreat with earneſtneſs, that of you, which would cure him, and therefore deſire it, that he might no more do you wrong, would you not give it him? we read when the Prodigal <hi>came to himſelf he went to his Father,</hi> and his Father with all readineſs, pity and love received him; when any go to God for his Spirit in Chriſt, then begin they to come to themſelves.</p>
               <p>God ſaith to us, if thine enemy thirſt give him drink, ſure then, if any ſoul though it have been a great enemy to God, do thirſt for his Spirit, and lye at the door of his mercy crying for it, through Chriſt, There is mercy enough in the heart of God to look out upon it, as it were to come forth to it, and beſtow his ſpirit upon it; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.32, 33, 34. <hi>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye Children, for bleſſed are they</hi> (ſaith wiſdom) <hi>that keep my wayes, hear inſtruction, and be wiſe, and refuſe it not, Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my Gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors.</hi> Why is ſuch a one bleſſed? <hi>

Doth not Chriſt commend the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> who had compaſſion, on the wounded man, who could not help himſelf, and poured in oyl into his wounds? <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.33, 34. ſurely the Lord is as good him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I, and much more compaſſionate towards poor ſinners who are far more miſerable and helpleſs. If then thou wounded ſoul by thy ſins, and no way able to heal thy wounds, to ſubdue thy ſins, ſhalt indeed look to him, cry unto him, will he not pour the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (which is called the oyl of gladneſs) into thy heart? Yes, no doubt he will.</p>
               <p>I dare ſay this (to thee O ſoul) if thou haſt a

               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 10. Seeing it is through the ſpirit that our ſins are to be mortified, take the ſpirit's time for the mortifying of them. What time is that? it is the preſent time. The ſpirit loveth no delayes in a matter of ſo great conſequence, it hates our ſins, therefore would that we ſhould ſeek to deſtroy them immediately without any putting off. O! Alas,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97673:78"/>how many have been ruined by their ſins, becauſe they have deferred to ſeek the ruine of them? They have never had the Spirit's help, becauſe they would not take the Spirit's time. Beware that be not true of any of you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. laſt. <hi>But to</hi> Iſrael, (obſerve that, to <hi>Iſrael</hi> a people enjoying the word, and living under ordinances) he ſaith, <hi>all day long I have ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient, and gain ſaying people.</hi> I have tendred mercy, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed help and aſſiſtance, to a people who have all day long from morning to evening of the day of grace, ſlighted my mercy, and refuſed my help, the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and leading of my Spirit. No delay paſt ſhall be charged upon you, if now you have a heart to yield your ſelves to the Spirit, for the ſubduing your iniquities, but take heed of delaying ſtill. Now, even now, the bleſſed Spirit offereth you its help, now in the Goſpel, now in the Word Preached, <hi>my Spirit</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall not alway ſtrive with man,</hi> believe it now the Spirit ſtriveth with you, and makes a tender of its aſſiſtance. But more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially doth the ſpirit offer its help, when it begins to move, and breath and work in any ſoul, Give ear I pray, have you no movings, no workings, no ſtirrings or convictions of the Spirit? do you bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear a ſound of words? do you feel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? doth not the Spirit many times convince you? doth it not frequently ſtir you up againſt your ſins, and againſt this or that ſin in particular? have you not now ſome ſtirrings of the Spirit?</p>
               <p>Remember this, whenever the Spirit moveth in you, it offereth you its aſſiſtance, therefore if you have any hatred of your ſins, any love of your ſouls, any deſire to be helpt by the Spirit againſt your corruption, accept its offer, now accept it, and ſet upon this good and neceſſary work forthwith, take
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97673:79"/>up arms, and uſe them againſt your ſin, giving up yourſelf to the Spirit, that it may enable you to do that, for which you are utterly impotent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient in your ſelves. Go along with the Spirit, that way it moves you, that way go; what it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth you on to, that do. It is a moſt dangerous thing to neglect the offer of the holy good Spirit of God, to ſlight or let ſlip any of its counſels or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo may the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit now ſay to many a one, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37, 38.) how oft would I have helped you, and you would not? behold your ſoul is left unto you deſolate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 11. Take heed all you who have the Spirit, that you do no way provoke it, no way grieve it, becauſe the great war you are ſtill, while you live, to carry on againſt corrupt nature and its luſtings, can only be effectually managed by the help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Why is it that the Spirit of grace doth aſſiſt us no more in this warfare? whence is it, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Spirits ſo oft prevail and get us under? Is it becauſe the Spirit in us, is not able to help us? that cannot be, it hath given our ſouls life when quite dead, therefore it can lay our ſins quite dead at its pleaſure, and give our ſouls life more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. Is it becauſe the ſpirit is not willing or ready to afford us its aſſiſtance? neither can that be, it being given to us to help us; to think it unwilling, is to think it unfaithful, but the holy ſpirit cannot be unfaithful, and to think it unwilling, is to think it unloving, unkind, uncompaſſionate, but that ſpirit that works all kindneſs, love and compaſſion, that is gracious in every ſoul, muſt needs be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loving, kind, and full of compaſſion it ſelf. What's the reaſon then, that this, that, and the other ſin ſo oft gets the maſtery in us, who have the ſpirit in us. Whence is it, that ſpiritual ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97673:79"/>ſo much prevails in ſome, worldlineſs in others, lukewarmneſs, pride, envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in others? whence are ſome ſo unſtable in the truth, ſo unconſtant in that which is good? whence ſuch dead heartedneſs, ſuch carnality, ſuch vain-glory, ſuch diſcontent and uncircumſpect walking among us? Sure, the Spirit is not kindly entertained by us as it ought to be, we grieve it, we offend and diſpleaſe it. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> was never beaten by their enemies, but ſtill prevailed againſt them, unleſs God were ſome way greatly provoked by them, and ſo left them in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to themſelves, to their own ſtrength and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which ever proved too weak, ſhort, and fooliſh to hold them up when the Lord was withdrawn from them. So it is, when our foul enemies prevail, the Spirit of God is diſpleaſed by us. Therefore be more kind to, be more tender towards it, Let us ever be careful as for our lives, that we never grieve our great and only helper.</p>
               <p>There are many wayes that the Spirit is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one is that even now mentioned, neglecting its motions, not working when it calls upon, and puts us on to work, not fighting when it moves us, or not as it moveth us to fight againſt our luſts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, there are five or ſix wayes I ſhall now mention of grieving the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Running upon temptation, when you do ſo, you tempt the Spirit, which tempting it, is griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, when you needleſſely run upon an occaſion of ſin, and venter upon any foreſeen temptation (having no call) hoping the Spirit will help you againſt it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Willing or careleſs neglect of any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Believe, (O that you would believe me, when I ſpeak truth) you never willingly, or careleſſely neglect a duty, but you grieve the Spirit. You may
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97673:80"/>pretend one and another thing, but the Spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived; it ſearcheth all things, and as for you in whom it dwells, know you, it doth more eſpecially obſerve, your whole converſation, and all the workings of your ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Yielding to any thing at any time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your conſcience; when you offend conſcience, you grieve the ſpirit; if conſcience be diſpleaſed, the ſpirit is diſpleaſed, though not alway in the ſame reſpect, thy conſcience ſaith, doing ſuch a thing, thou doſt not do well, yet wilt thou do it, now doſt thou provoke the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Not trying thoſe motions that are in you by the word, what they are, or whence they come. For hereupon, (you oftner then you are aware of) give entertainment to Satan's motions and yield to them, as if they were from the ſpirit of holineſs, (eſpecially then <hi>when Salan transforms himſelf notably into an Angel of light</hi>) and what a grieving the ſpirit this is, it's eaſie to conceive, for you through negligence, raſhneſs, or inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not trying things as you ought, to follow the wicked one, inſtead of the Holy one.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Deſpiſing the counſel of ſuch who have the ſpirit, which is too ordinary a caſe. I ſuppoſe it will be confeſs'd this is a grieving the ſpirit, and it muſt be granted it is too too common. Either the counſel of ſuch is deſpiſed by not ſeeking it, when it is needful, (the law ſhould be ſought at their mouth who have the teaching of the ſpirit, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.11.) or when good counſel is given, and is not followed, but is neglected, be it through flightineſs, obſtinacy, conceit of your own underſtanding, or a being bent to your own mind, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. laſt, it is ſo after my judgment, and I think I have the ſpirit of God, (he means as to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97673:80"/>that his Advice) and therefore (as if he ſhould have ſaid) beware that you deſpiſe not my counſel, leſt you grieve the ſpirit, whoſe counſel it is by me.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Giving way to unbelieving thoughts, the ſuffering to lodg in you any evil thought grieves the ſpirit, particularly and eſpecially, a thought of unbelief, when you entertain it, nouriſh it, or ſtrive not to turn it out. Now let the conſideration of your need of the ſpirit and the great work you have to do by it, which can by no means be done without it, make you heedful that the ſpirit, be not grieved by you, theſe, or any other wayes. And if you find not the ſpirit helping you againſt your ſin, you may conclude one of theſe two things, either you have it not, and then you muſt ſeek it as before, or you have ſome way grieved it, and then you muſt conſider wherein, make confeſſion, beg pardon, and amend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 12. Be perſwaded every one who hath the ſpirit, in all you do againſt your ſin, to do it, alway through the ſpirit, for as much as this is a ſure way and the only way of doing any thing ſucceſsfully. All (remember it) all is loſt labour, and worſe than labour barely loſt, if not through the ſpirit, for to attempt any thing without it, is a ſlighting it, and the mercy of God in beſtowing it. And this indeed is one principal way of grieving the ſpirit, to ſeek or think to tread down your luſts without its help; when any have a good friend, who can aſſiſt them in a difficult matter neceſſary to be done by them for their good, which they cannot bring about without him, it is an offence to him, it will grieve him, if he be not made uſe of; its a part of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and a precept thereof, to uſe our friend in a time of need; a true friend is as much offended, if you will not uſe him, when you need his help, as he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97673:81"/>is diſpleaſed, if you refuſe your aſſiſtance when he needs help from you. I am apt to think, we grieve the ſpirit as by nothing more greatly, ſo by nothing more frequently than by this, we forget the ſpirit, we beg not its helping preſence enough, we truſt not in it as we ought, we have too much a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in our own endeavours, reſolutions and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or in grace received. Thus the ſpirit is griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo it aſſiſteth us not as elſe it would, hence our luſts are ſo ſtrong, what we do, proves in vain; If one ſin be ſomewhat kept under, another riſeth up in its room, and that retains its life alſo ſtill, and breaks forth again; if outward acts of ſin are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prevented, yet ſin it continues and prevails within.</p>
               <p>Hence alſo we are ſo oft almoſt quite diſcouraged in oppoſing ſin, and even ſometimes ready to think it unconquerable, and hence we undergoe more difficulty than we need (as hath been ſaid) like as when one combats with an enemy alone, too ſtrong for him, when he may have help, he hath more trouble than he need to have, this is folly, it's as when a Child will attempt and force it ſelf to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that alone, which is too heavy for it, and above its ſtrength; and is it not dangerous to ſet forth againſt an enemy too hard for us, without that help we may have, and God hath graciouſly afforded us? This is preſumption, this provokes God to let us fall into and under temptation, this encourageth Satan againſt us, and ſtrengthens him, this is a wrong to the death of Chriſt whereby the ſpirit hath been obtained for us. Therefore receive the counſel gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, into your hearts, let it be written and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven there, whenever you reſolve againſt ſin, let it be through the ſpirit, whenever you ſtrive againſt any ſin, let it be through the ſpirit, give your ſelf
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97673:81"/>up to the Spirit, that you may be conducted, led forth, guided, and ſtrengthned by it.</p>
               <p>This is an honourable way of ſpiritual fighting, under the conduct of ſuch a leader, the mighty glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spirit, our luſts are the baſeſt enemies (the worſe is it to be overcome by them) but the Spirit is a moſt excellent Leader.</p>
               <p>Some may ſay, I have endeavoured through the Spirit, ſeeking it, and truſting in it for the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of my ſin, yet is it not mortified.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, don't you know, it is ſo ſometimes that a ſick man thinks himſelf worſe than he was, when his Diſeaſe is much abated, becauſe he is more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it than he was, ſo is it as to ſin; And it is one part of Satan's work to bely the work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. As when men go forth againſt their ſins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit, Satan endeavours to cauſe them to think their ſin dead when it lives as much as ever, having no deadly wound at all, ſo when any do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and fight againſt their ſin by the Spirit, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirreth himſelf to cauſe them to think that their ſin retaineth it's former life and ſtrength, when indeed it is dying and much weakned. It cannot be, but, if you have truely oppoſed ſin through the Spirit, that it is mortified in a good degree, it is mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dying though not quite mortified and dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. As you ſhould not think your corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions weaker, ſo neither ſhould you look upon them as ſtronger than they are. It is a diſgraceful inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a Phyſician, when his Patients get good by his preſcriptions, and are really better, for them to ſay they are as bad, as ſick as ever, they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten no good thereby. So is it a diſhonour and wrong to the bleſſed moſt precious ſpirit of grace, for thoſe who have it, and are acted by it, or make uſe of it, to ſay they are never the better, that their ſins retain
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97673:82"/>their former ſtrength notwithſtanding, as if the Spirit of God were either weak, unskilful, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful. It's good for us to think and confeſs the worſt of our ſelves, and we ſhould be humbled and aſhamed that our ſins are no more ſubdued, but we muſt beware that we diſhonour not the ſpirit, nor ſpeak more againſt our ſelves than is true; as we muſt not ſpeak falſly for God, ſo not againſt our ſelves, all falſe witneſs is a tranſgreſſion of the Law.</p>
               <p>Yet let me ſay, our hearts are very deceitful in this thing, we do not alway act through the ſpirit, nor are we ſenſible of our need of it, nor do we ſo heartily ſeek it, or rely on it as we ſometimes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; I doubt not, there are many who can teſtifie that they have experienced the deceitfulneſs of their hearts in this, as well as in other things; they have thought that they did reſolve and ſtrive through the ſpirit, but afterward they have found that they did look too much to themſelves, and too little to the ſpirit, that they had more ſelf confidence than they were aware of.</p>
               <p>Some may here deſire farther advice how they ſhall do this work through the ſpirit, how their hearts ſhall be brought to a thorow truſt in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that they may have its help againſt their ſins. To which I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, When ſin prevails in you, not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that, but this, that you have not made uſe of the ſpirit, nor relyed on it as you ought; it will be a good help to your having more of the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit hereafter, if you be ſenſible of, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with brokenneſs of heart, your neglect of the ſpirit heretofore, that you have not gone forth againſt your ſin through it as you ſhould. There is too little of this confeſſion, we confeſs the ſtirrings and breakings forth of corruption, but we
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97673:82"/>forget altogether or too much to acknowledge this cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Remember to ſeek not only the ſpirit's powerful, but alſo its counſelling and directing aſſiſtance, we greatly need both, we are weak, therefore need the Spirit's ſtrength, we are unwiſe and fooliſh, therefore need its counſel. As we have not power to do, ſo neither underſtanding to diſcern what we ſhould do againſt our ſins, what is the beſt way and courſe to mortifie them; It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual for men to take ſuch a courſe for the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſin as rather ſtrengthneth, than weakneth it. Enemies are overcome as oft, if not oftner, by policy, than by main force; ſo our ſins are to be conquered by wiſdom as well as (if not more than) by ſtrength. Therefore look for the ſpirit to help you both, as a ſpirit of power, and alſo as a ſpirit of wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Beg that the ſpirit would not only help you againſt your ſins, but that it would cauſe you to make uſe of, and truſt in it ſelf for its help, that it would ſhew you more and more your need of it, convince you of your own weakneſs, and fooliſhneſs, that you may have no confidence in your ſelves, but wholly depend on it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Set your ſelves againſt every ſin through the ſpirit; it may be you look for and deſire the ſpirit's aſſiſtance againſt ſome ſpecial ſtrong cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but you muſt ſeek its help againſt all, or you'l hardly have it againſt any; you muſt not think any ſin ſo ſmall that it needs not to be mortified, nor any ſo weak that you can kill it of your ſelves, it offends the ſpirit if you ſo think. It's much what a like evil to think any ſin too ſtrong, to be ſubdued by the ſpirit, and to think any ſo ſmall that it need not, or ſo weak that without the ſpirit it may be mortified.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:97673:83"/>
               <p>Fifthly, Make ſure of this that you are in Chriſt, and have received the ſpirit from him, and then ſtedfaſtly expect its conduct, powerful aſſiſtance, and counſel for the deſtruction of your ſins; Look upon it as your helper, and have a raiſed firm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation without wavering of its help, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. <hi>the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and will preſerve me unto his heavenly Kingdom,</hi> ſo you may and ſhould ſay, the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall deliver me from every luſt, and will preſerve me from the dominion of every corruption, yea and deſtroy all my ſins, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave me, nor forſake me, till it have brought me off victorious, it will help me, it will give me a full compleat victory overall mine iniquities.</p>
               <p>But let this your confident expectation be rightly grounded. How is that? I anſwer, you ſhould confidently expect the ſpirits full help, upon theſe and ſuch like grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As it is the ſpirit of the Father, that which the Father hath promiſed and given you, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the ſpirit is called <hi>the promiſe of the Father, Acts.</hi> 1.4. and Chriſt ſaith, it <hi>proceedeth from the Father,</hi> therefore look for it, as ſo; think not it will help you only or ſo much, becauſe you need it, or will to be help'd by it, (or for any other reaſon with reſpect to your ſelves) as becauſe the Father willeth it ſhould help you, and hath promiſed and given it for that purpoſe, and ſo it's the Father's work to do in you, and with you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Expect it's help as the ſpirit of Chriſt, as that which proceeds from the Son, &amp; which Chriſt hath obtained, and <hi>ſent to you from the Father,</hi> Chriſt dyed and aſcended to interceed that you might have it, he ſhed his blood alſo that your ſins might be deſtroyed through it, he hath ſent it into
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97673:83"/>your hearts, therefore look for it's, help upon Chriſt's account, and as you belong to Chriſt, as you are in him, his members, ſo that what the ſpirit doth for you, it doth for Chriſt, as they who ſhew kindneſſe to any of Chriſt's members, feeding, viſiting, cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, he ſaith ſhew kindneſſe to himſelf, ſo the ſpirit helping you, helps Chriſt, as you are of his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Expect the ſpirit's help alſo for it's own ſake, becauſe you are it's <hi>Temple,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. It hath freely come to you, it doth dwell in you, and it is to <hi>abide with you for ever, John</hi> 14.16. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſpirit is concern'd in your welfare, it help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to mortifie your ſins, honoureth itſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying your ſins, he deſtroyeth his own enemies, the enemies of his own habitation, his own temple.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Expect it's aſſiſtance upon the account of the everlaſtingneſſe and freeneſſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein God hath ſaid he will give us his ſpirit, and cauſe us to walk in his ſtatutes, which is to be underſtood for all our life long, the Covenant gives aſſurance of the conſtant aſſiſtance of the ſpirit to the end; upon ſuch accounts as theſe ſtedfaſtly look for, ſtrongly expect the ſpirits help, ſo certainly you ſhall not miſſe of it, you may upon the grounds men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſay of your ſins, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.46, 47. <hi>The Lord will deliver thee into mine hand, and I will ſmite thee, and take thine head from thee, and all ſhall know that the Lord ſaveth not with ſword &amp; ſpear, for the battell is the Lords, &amp; he will give you into mine hands.</hi> Our truſt in the ſpirit is not right, if we expect not it's help; the greater our expectation is, the greater our truſt, and the greater engagement upon our friend to help us.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If after all, you at any time find ſin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing yet be not out of heart, if you are, that's the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97673:84"/>way to have it prevail again, and more, but ſtir up your ſelves to your duty in your ſpirituall warfare, renew your truſt in the ſpirit, be more earneſt in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for it's help: As <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they fled before the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> they went and humbled themſelves, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and prayed, ſo when you as flee before your ſin, when beaten by your ſpiritual enemies, go to God, be more importunate and urgent for help, ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.1, 2. <hi>Plead my cauſe O Lord, with them that ſtrive with me, fight against them which fight againſt me take hold of ſhield &amp; buckler, and ſtand up for my help, draw out the ſpear and ſtop the way againſt them, ſay unto my ſoul,</hi> (ſpeak it feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to my ſenſe) <hi>I am thy ſalvation, let them be confounded that ſeek after my ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. And as it is in the Prophet, <hi>Awake, O arm of the Lord, put on ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. By no means give way to diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that is unbelief, and a diſhonour to the ſpirit, as alſo to your ſelves, what is it but cowardiſe when a man is worſted, and he falls down under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, in this he is more conquered, than in the other: A right ſouldier, will ſtir up himſelf when foiled, and prepare for a new aſſault with the more eagerneſſe. That you may not at any time ſinck un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſcouragement becauſe of the prevalency of ſin, keep theſe three things in your mind.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though ſin hath overcome you, it hath not overcome the ſpirit in you, had he pleaſed he could have prevented it's having the maſtery, a ſure truth but not thought of in diſcouragement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You are never ſo maſtered by ſin, but the ſpirit can eaſily, ſuddenly help you to recover your ground, and to trample under foot that ſin which hath got you under, it's as eaſie with the ſpirit to ſubdue your ſin, as it was before it prevailed, yea he will, he ſurely will help you to repent which when
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97673:84"/>you do in truth, then you get the day of ſin, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if hearty) is overcoming, and call to mind, have you not oft, after the prevailing of this or that ſin, ſoon recovered your ſelves (through the ſpirit) when even as beaten out of the field, have you not regain'd your ground? and ſometimes been ſtronger than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and more ſucceſsfull in your combat.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſpirit would never ſuffer you at any time to be worſted by any ſin but for ſome wiſe ends, with reſpect both to your good, and it's glory.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Your good, though to be foiled by a baſe luſt be not good, the effect of it may be good, and the ſpirit would not permit it, but that he intends your good thereby, even your ſins getting the upperhand of you, the ſpirit intendeth to make uſe of for the ſubduing it, by humbling you, by making the blood of Chriſt more pretious to you, by cauſing you to hate your ſin the more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; With reſpect to the ſpirit's own glory, we by being maſtered diſhonour the ſpirit, ſo far as it is our fault (which it alway is, one way or other too much) but the ſpirit will thereby take occaſion to glorifie it ſelf, by beating down that ſin, which hath ſo ſtrongly wrought in us, to the throwing us down. The ſpirit's power againſt ſin, and it's love to us, will be the more manifeſted, it coming in to our relief when wely (as it were) under the feet of ſuch a corruption, ready to have our throat cut, or heart ſtab'd thereby. When one comes in to the help of a friend who is beaten out of the field, or juſt upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed at his ſtrong enemies feet, and recovers the field for him, lifts him up, and ſtrengthens him to drive out and deſtroy that his enemy, this is more honour to ſuch a one, and evidenceth his valour, ſtrength, and friendſhip more, than it would if he had been preſent to help before.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:97673:85"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 13. When you pray for any that their ſin may be deſtroyed (as you ſhould make this prayer for your relations, friends, and others) then pray for the ſpirit for them, ſeeing through it your prayer for them, only can be anſwered. It's a great argument of the carnality of Chriſtians, if they pray that the bodies of their children and other relations may be healed when ſick, they pray not for the healing of their ſouls, or if they ask any outward gift for them, and not the ſpirit, (it were well if ſome would give fewer blows and angry provoking words to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and put up more and more fervent prayers for them.) And it ſpeaks to little underſtanding of the Goſpel, when any pray for themſelves or others that they may ſin leſſe, be delivered from the power of ſin, but ask not the ſpirit, to help them. All your prayers muſt be according to ſcripture, for that you ſeek, in that way the word declares God uſeth to grant it.</p>
               <p>And in all counſells and exhortations which at any time you give to any concerning their getting rid of their ſins, be ſure to inſtruct them in, and mind them of this, tell them this and the other ſin in them it muſt be mortified, but through the ſpirit. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you do but teach them to skin over the ſore &amp; keep the diſeaſe inward, but not to heal it, (which may be more dangerous, than if it were left to break forth, as it is with ſome diſeaſes when they ſtrike out they are not ſo dangerous, as when kept all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; the breaking forth of ſin may help to conviction, whereas if kept in unmortified, one is ready to ſay or think what do I, who can lay any thing to my charge? he is clean to appearance, but not cleanſed from his filthineſſe) or ſtirring up any to mortifie their ſin, and not through the ſpirit, but in their own ſtrength you teach them ſo to ſin, you put them upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97673:85"/>your counſel may do more hurt than good, how can you expect it ſhould be bleſſed by God, when it's not according to his word? And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the perſon to whom it's given ſight it, putting it off with this, I cannot, I am not able, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe Satan may move men againſt ſome ſins in their own ſtrength to ſeek freedome from them, that he may weary and vex them, and make them deſperate, as I think it not improble that he may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther further than hinder ſome in the preventing the breakings forth of this or that ſin outwardly, that ſo they may bleſſe themſelves as if all were well with them, and not ſeek to have their ſin truly mortified, and killed in the root through the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 14. See what cauſe you have to be humble, very humble, though you do get great victory over your ſins, there is even nothing a ſoul is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be lifted up by than this, when he begins to get the better of thoſe ſins which have much prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, when he feels a ſtrong corruption weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But let us remember the Angels who never ſin'd are exceeding humble, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.11. <hi>John</hi> ſaw all the <hi>Angels ſtanding round about the throne, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on their faces, and worſhipping God,</hi> ſurely then, we who have ſin'd greatly, who do ſin daily, though we ſin much leſſe than we did or then others do, ſhould alway fall on our faces before God, we ſhould be very humble before him, I and before men too. The rather becauſe whatever we have done againſt ſin to any purpoſe hath neither been by our own power, nor underſtanding, but by the ſtrength and wiſdome of the ſpirit of God. If a man do a great work by another's help, hath he any cauſe to boaſt? if one ſhould heal a great and ſore Diſeaſe by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's preſcription, or write well having his hand guided by another, hath he reaſon to glory, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 44.3.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97673:86"/>
                  <hi>their own Arm did not ſave them, but thy right hand and thine arm,</hi> ſo not your power, but the power of Gods ſpirit hath brought under your ſins, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you from them; wherefore all the glory is due to him, you ſhould be as humble, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done. We read of a crown of life and glory promiſed to them who overcome: How ſo? not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſerve it by their overcoming; therefore when Saints ſhall be crowned they will aſcribe all the glory unto God and to Jeſus Chriſt by whoſe ſpirit, they have been made victorious, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I ſaw twenty four Elders ſitting clothed in white rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they had on their heads crowns, of gold,</hi> That is, durable glorious crowns given them with reſpect to their conquering.) And what then? <hi>V.</hi> 10. <hi>They fall down before the throne, and wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſhip him that liveth for ever and ever, and caſt their crowns before the throne, ſaying, thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, honour, and power,</hi> as if they had ſaid, though we are crowned, yet we in our ſelves are not worthy of our crowns, but thou art worthy of glory, honour, and power, for by the power of thy ſpirit, it is that we have vanquiſhed our enemies, and have won theſe Crowns. It's another principal way of grieving the ſpirit, when we mortifying any ſin through it, do take the glory to our ſelves, which we do, when we grow high minded and puf't up in our ſpirits thereby. And it's one of the beſt evidences, that our ſins are indeed mortified by the holy ſpirit, when our pride is mortified, ſo that we are ſtill humble, as well when we overcome this or that luſt, as when we are overcome by it. There is no ſin more hatefull to the ſpirit of God, than pride is, therefore it helping us againſt other ſins, it will ſurely ſmite that.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Be exhorted to get more of the ſpirit, you
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97673:86"/>who are endued with it, who have it dwelling in you, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be filled with the ſpirit,</hi> the ſpirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by degrees, and in divers meaſures, the more you are filled with it, the more you'l be emptied of your luſts through it, the more effectually and eaſily will you prevail againſt every ſin, that hath been too hard for you.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we gain more of the ſpirit? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The ſame way the ſpirit is received at firſt, more thereof is to be attained, and that's by faith; The more we act faith on Chriſt, and on the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the more we earneſtly pray in faith, the more ſhall we receive and be filled with that mighty ſin-killing, luſt deſtroying, ſpirit of the Lord.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="sermon">
               <head>Sermon 8. and Laſt.</head>
               <p>I Am now come to the laſt thing to be conſidered in this Text, which I ſhall briefly diſpatch and put an iſſue thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D.</hi> 3. That they who do mortifie the deeds of the body of ſin through the ſpirit, they ſhall live. As they who live after the fleſh ſhall dy, ſo they who do mortifie the affections, luſts and motions of the fleſh ſhall live, ſo be it, that they do this through the ſpirit, becauſe elſe its not done in truth, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And there is this difference to be remembred, they who live after the fleſh deſerve tody, they earn the wages of death, it's not ſo here, that they who mortifie the deeds of ſin, do deſerve to live, for, though (as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ro.</hi> 6. laſt) <hi>The wages of ſin is death, yet the gift of God is eternall life through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> God freely gives life, and Chriſt hath
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97673:87"/>by his obedience to death obtain'd it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him,</hi> Chriſt was ſent to dye, that we might live, otherwiſe we could never by any means have had life. yet is this, (the mortification of ſin) the way to, though not the cauſe of life, it neceſſarily preceeds life.</p>
               <p>Two things I ſhall ſpeak a little to, before I come to the Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Shew how they ſhall live who do this. 2. Give ſome reaſons for the confirmation of the truth.</p>
               <p>How ſhall they live who do this? anſwer, look how they ſhall dye who live after the fleſh, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way ſhall they live who mortifie the deeds of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If we do this we ſhall live the life of grace, of holineſs, which is called the <hi>life of God,</hi> Eph. 4.18. <hi>Having the underſtanding darkned, being alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart.</hi> How excellent, how deſirable is their life, which is the life of God, even that life ſhall we live, let us but get our ſin dead through the Spirit of God, Chriſt the Son of God will live in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> He did through Chriſt dwelling in him live a ſpiritual holy life, ſo ſhall we live; it's true none can do any thing this way (to purpoſe) till they are quickned, and have ſome ſpiritual life in them, can thoſe who lye dead in their graves, kill the worms that feed upon them? No more can any while they lye dead in their ſins, mortifie their ſins, they have not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, therefore cannot act through it. But if we do deſtroy our corruptions through the ſpirit, then we are quickned, and we ſhall retain that ſpiritual life
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97673:87"/>we have, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>If ye do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall,</hi> never fall as <hi>Adam</hi> did, ſo as to loſe, our ſpiritual life, as they of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks that they are <hi>twice dead,</hi> (though he means not that ever they had a reall principle of ſpiritual life) ſhould it be that any of us (who have the ſpirit) ſhould grow quite negligent in this work of ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſins, ſhould we altogether give it over, then ſhould we become like thoſe twice dead; ſin, as I may ſay, would choak, would ſtrangle our ſouls, or the new creature in us. But we continuing to keep under and to ſlay our ſins, ſo the life of grace we have, ſhall be retained, and we ſhall not fall into a dead frame, yea thus ſhall we have life <hi>more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,</hi> we ſhall be more lively God-ward in all duties and good works, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2, 3. Chriſt exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Church of <hi>Sardis, to strengthen the things that did remain, which were ready to dye,</hi> and for that end biddeth them <hi>repent,</hi> mortifie their ſin; through the neglect whereof ſome good things were even as dead already, and others were in a dying caſe, it will not be ſo with us, if we herein do our duty, but all good will live in us, and it will grow more lively, ſo we ſhall be farther, and farther from dying.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We ſhall live a life of peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25. <hi>we ſhall live in the ſpirit,</hi> in the peace, comfort and joy thereof, <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> we read, <hi>conſiſts in righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but the more we mortifie our ſin through the ſpirit, the more of the Kingdom of God as it conſiſts in righteouſneſs, whereupon alſo we ſhall have the more of the Kingdom of God as it conſiſts in peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, we ſhall have the more ſenſe of our juſtification, and of our peace with God, a more clear diſcerning of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97673:88"/>the forgiveneſs of our iniquities, a more quiet and acquitting conſcience, more of the rejoycing of the teſtimony of a good conſcience, (and the very ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our corruptions becauſe they are enemies will adminiſter joy) yea peace ſhall we have in great trouble, joy in the midſt of great ſorrow, for its not affliction, ſo much as corruption that deprives our heart of comfort, peace and joy; Nor can any trouble drown our conſolation, and chearfulneſs of ſpirit wholly, if our ſin be but mortified by the ſpirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. <hi>though in heavineſs by manifold temptations,</hi> yet ſhall our hearts <hi>greatly rejoyce.</hi> As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the worldly man's mirth (<hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13.) <hi>even in laughter the qeart is ſorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heavineſs,</hi> ſo as to a Godly man's ſorrow (if he keep conſtant and diligent in warring againſt his ſin) even in his mourning his his heart is joyful, and the end of that heavineſs, is gladneſs.</p>
               <p>Perhaps God may withdraw, and much try ſuch a one, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o his heart will have great ſorrow, yet not without a ſecret mixture of joy, and if his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſeem to be dead, it is but as a ſleep, it will ſoon awake, and no true joy or peace can be while ſin is permitted to bear ſway in the ſoul, and is not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily oppoſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We ſhall live a life of all true ſpiritual happineſs while we are here, we ſhall have God's favour, wherein (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>there is life</hi>) and which is better than life, yea for the moſt part (at leaſt) we ſhall or may have the ſhining of it into us, the light of God's countenance ever and anon lifted up upon us; we ſhall have the bleſſing of God, all things will be bleſt to us, many affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will graciouſly be prevented, thoſe that come will be ſanctified to us, ſo that they ſhall not hurt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97673:88"/>us (ſpiritually, no more than the fiery furnace did the three Children outwardly, our ſouls thereby ſhall not be ſo much as ſinged, as their clothes were not by that devouring fire) nothing ſhall befall us, that will be evil to us in it's effect; No good thing ſhall be wanting to us, we ſhall thrive under ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, we ſhall hear and live, we ſhall be fed with and feed on the bread of life, our duties and our labours ſhall live, we ſhall experience the truth of thoſe, (and other like words) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>we ſhall be like a tree planted by the Rivers of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its ſeaſon,</hi> our leaf ſhall not wither, and whatſoever we do ſhall proſper, ſo the bleſſing of God will attend us, and his favour compaſs us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When we come to dye a natural death we ſhall live much better, we ſhall preſently live in our ſouls perfectly, and ſo ſhall we after a while live in our whole man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29. <hi>we ſhall come out of our graves to the reſurrection of life,</hi> as Chriſt liveth, ſo ſhall we live, (and O how doth he live now, there above!) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. <hi>though he was crucified through weakneſs, yet he liveth by the power of God,</hi> we alſo are weak in, or with him; but we ſhall live with him, if ſin dye in us through the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, thereby we have great aſſurance, that we ſhall live with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. <hi>if we be dead with Chriſt, we believe that we ſhall alſo live with him, to him that overcometh,</hi> ſaith the faithful and true witneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. <hi>will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God,</hi> which words ſeem to have reſpect to that ſpoken to <hi>Adam,</hi> after he had ſinned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>leſt he put forth his hand and take alſo of the tree of life, and live for ever,</hi> therefore the Lord God ſent him forth out of Paradiſe, now ſaith Chriſt, though
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97673:89"/>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> having ſin'd, (and being mortified by ſin) might not eat of, or touch, or come near the tree of life, that he ſhould live for ever (as he hoped or ſuppoſed he thereby ſhould) yet to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh his temptations and corruptions, will I give to eat, (I'le not only permit him to eat, but I'le give him to eat) of the tree of life in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God (even the third heavens, that beſt place of all the creation, as Paradiſe was of all the earth) and ſo he ſhall live for ever (far better than <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſtate could have lived.) Hear men, and brethren; thus (O thus!) ſhall ye live, if ye will ſo fight againſt your ſins, as not to let them live in you. They ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts. 22.22. it's not fit that he ſhould live, ſo the world may ſay of us, (and we conſidered in our ſelves have great reaſon to acknowledge we are not fit to live any life, no not here in this preſent evil world) but, through grace, we ſhall live a life ten thouſand, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand, much better, a life glorious and everlaſting, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>we ſhall have an entrance adminiſtred abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for a few arguments to demonſtrate, and help faith, as to this truth, that they who ſo do (as is expreſs'd) ſhall ſo live, as is declared.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it muſt be ſo, becauſe otherwiſe the ſpirit's work in us ſhould be loſt, the ſpirit's helping and aſſiſting us againſt our ſins, ſhould be in vain, to what purpoſe ſhould the ſpirit of the Lord enable us in this work, if we being help'd ſhould not live, but dye at laſt? Therefore ſhall we live, for the ſpirit's almighty ſpecial work cannot be loſt, our working alone might well be, and would be in vain and diſowned by God, but that which we do through the powerful aſſiſtance and effectual workings of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97673:89"/>Holy Ghoſt, will ſurely be owned by the Father, for the ſpirit's ſake, and his own ſake who ſent it to ſtrengthen us, and Chriſt's ſake alſo who obtained it for us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit is the Spirit of life, it's he that <hi>quickneth, Joh.</hi> 6.63, it is the <hi>living water</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks of, and if we mortifie our ſins through it, it hath quickned us, we begin already to live through it, and it dwelleth in us, therefore we ſhall live, more and more, till we come to live the life of perfection and glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwel in you, he that hath raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit, that dwelleth in you;</hi> and in the mean time it will be quickning our immortal ſouls as to that death whereto by ſin they are obnoxious or lyable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Having the Spirit of Chriſt we are in him, we are one with him, and this is a ſure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and infallible teſtimony that Chriſt hath dyed for us, he hath ſo taken our ſins upon him, that he hath taken them away, he hath ſo born them, that he hath born them away for ever from us; he hath ſatisfied divine juſtice as to all our iniquities, and fulfilled the law, and now <hi>appears in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God for us.</hi> Rom. 8.3, 4. <hi>God ſent Chriſt, that the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us</hi> (in our nature for us) <hi>who walk not after the ſleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> and it's ſure we do walk after the Spirit, if we mortifie our ſins through the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtle gives us another Argument, in the words next following my Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. for (ſaith he, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> for, that is, for this reaſon it muſt be ſo, <hi>that if we through the Spirit,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97673:90"/>mortifie the deeds of the body, we ſhall live,</hi> becauſe, we ſo doing are led by the Spirit, which ever lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſouls led by it to life, (as Satan leads ſouls that walk after him to death) and our being led by the Spirit, proves that we are the Children of the living God, whoſe Children ſhall ſurely live; the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life will give life, the beſt, all life to his Children; and thoſe whom he makes his Children, are therefore ſo made by him, that they might live in him, to him, and with him for ever. As Chriſt faith, <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> ſo he is not the Father of the dead, but of the living, only of ſuch to whom he doth and will give life, all his Children ſhall have life from him, he will be their life.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Either we ſhall dye or live, there is no middle between death and life, but if we through the Spirit put ſin to death, if we mortifie it, then we ſhall not dye, becauſe none dye but it is by ſin, as by the guilt, ſo by the power of ſin, ſin kills all who periſh, but if ſin be killed in us, we ſhall not be killed or deſtroyed by it. He that ſlayeth his enemies, ſhall not be ſlain by them. He that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth the diſeaſes that ſeize on his body, ſhall not by them be mortified in his body.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, if we could mortifie ſin, ſo as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſin more, then no doubt we ſhould live, but, Alas, whatever we do againſt ſin, ſtill we ſin, yea, even continually one way or other. <hi>A.</hi> But it ſhall not be alway ſo, the day will come when you ſhall ſin no more, and in the mean time there is a party in you that ſinneth not, the Spirit ſinneth not, nor doth the ſeed of God in you, the new man, the new creature, and if you through the Spirit do ſeek and are ſet upon a hearty endeavouring the death of ſin, then the ſin that comes from you, is rather to be
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97673:90"/>look'd upon, as from corruption remaining, than from you, becauſe you have a contrary principle, and the ſin that flows from you is againſt your will. as it is not the Palſey man that ſhakes his head, or hand, but the Palſey, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.16. <hi>If then I do that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me,</hi> ſhould any one take your hand and ſmite another therewith againſt your will, would you not ſay, you did not ſmite him? ſo your ſin (whoſe hearts are in truth bent againſt it) is not accounted to you, that it ſhould prejudice you, and hinder your attaining life, but you ſhall live, as ſurely, as if you were wholly freed from ſin, and did never ſin at all. I know that ſpeech of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle may be, hath been, and is (no doubt) much abuſed, by ſuch who underſtand it not, or uſe it to harden themſelves, to ſtop the mouth of conſcience, and of ſuch who juſtly reprove them, as it was wreſted and miſuſed by that <hi>Antinomian</hi> Maid, who being ask'd how ſtolen Cloaths came to be in her Cheſt, anſwered, it was not I, but ſin that dwelleth in me. But if that Scripture be rightly underſtood, and applyed, it is of great good uſe, and it doth eſtabliſh and confirm the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent truth.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>if God be for us, who can be against us,</hi> but if we through the Spirit make war to purpoſe againſt our ſin, then God is for us, we are on God's ſide; <hi>who is on my ſide, who?</hi> (ſaid <hi>Jehu</hi>) whereupon one looking out at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow he bid him throw <hi>Jezabel</hi> down, who was his enemy, whereby that man ſhewed himſelf to be on <hi>Jehu</hi>'s ſide; ſo when we heartily ſeek to throw out and break the neck of that <hi>Jezabel,</hi> ſin that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, (which is enmity to God) then are we on God's ſide, and God is on our ſide, he is for us,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97673:91"/>if we are for him. As he is curſed who helps not the Lord againſt the mighty, ſo he is bleſſed that doth go forth againſt his ſin, that may be applyed to ſin which is ſpoken of <hi>Babylon, Pſ.</hi> 137. 2 laſt. O corruption, O luſt which art to be deſtroyed, happy ſhall he be who rewardeth thee, as thou haſt ſerved us, happy ſhall he be that taketh and daſheth thy little ones againſt the ſtones, who ſeeks thy utter deſtruction!</p>
               <p>In a word, ſin hath not dominion over thoſe, who mortifie it through the Spirit, therefore they are under grace, therefore they ſhall live through grace; they are in the covenant of grace, which is a covenant of life, therefore they ſhall have life according to, and by the covenant.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. LEarn hence a reaſon of that deadneſs that is upon the Spirits of men, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors too commonly; how many have a name to live, yet are dead? and how many are under great deadneſs as to all holy duties, all ordinances, all good works, reprobate, or much like ſuch who are <hi>reprobate to every good work,</hi> Tit. 1. laſt, ſpeak to them, call, cry aloud and tell them, this, that, is their duty, ſhew it them by Scripture, yet (O ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) they have no life, no heart to it; you had even as good call upon a dead man to eat, to drink, or hear and do any thing you ſhall ſay to him. Why, what's the matter with men that they are thus dead, their hearts, their conſciences, their wills, and affections dead? the cauſe is palpable, their ſin
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97673:91"/>liveth, luſt is unmortified. Know it, whoever of you are under prevailing deadneſs of ſpirit to, or in that which is good, and your duty, deadneſs of heart God-ward, there is ſome luſt or other that is lively in you, ſeeing they ſhall live who do mortifie the deeds of ſin. And as for thoſe who are dead at heart (eſpecially if they are daily ſo) be it as to any good, or as to joy, peace and comfort, let them conſider, whether it ariſe not hence, the prevalency of ſome ſin in them, the death whereof, they have not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly ſought, through the Spirit. Or if any are without the life of happineſs, by God's countenance ſhining upon them, look well into thy ſelf, ſearch and ſee, is there not earthly mindedneſs, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, love of the world, pride, impatience, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, envy, or ſome other iniquity unmortified, and which through the Spirit, thou ſeekeſt not the deſtruction of. Or if any are born down with fear, overcome with doubts concerning their living here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, (though this, through temptation may be the caſe of a very gracious ſoul) yet it's not without ground to adviſe and perſwade ſuch alſo to try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this matter, whether there be no luſt they ſeek not the death of, or whether what they do be not through themſelves, rather than through the Spirit. Becauſe this is given as an evidence of life, therefore (uſually) the Spirit of God doth bear witneſs with their Spirits, who do through it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their ſins, that they ſhall live. In the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral this is a truth, and (ſetting aſide ſome particular ſpecial caſes) it will be found true as to all; whatever death or deadneſs any lye under, it is cauſed by ſome ſin open or ſecret which they don't uſe means by the Spirit to deſtroy. And therefore, let the ſecond uſe be.</p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:97673:92"/>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. To perſwade you all (yet once again) to this ſo great a duty, be perſwaded one and all (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly you who are under deadneſſe) to mortifie your ſin through the ſpirit, you who have not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, O that you would enter upon this combate, you who have begun, hold on, go forward, and be more induſtrious here in, in this time of wars and rumours of wars (which may as yet increaſe with other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying killing judgments) let this be your war, your daily fight becauſe this is the way to life. Is there any one of you, but deſireth to live in the ſenſe of my Text? Can you be content with a ſhort, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain natural life, and not look after that which is far better, ſeeing it may be attained, and the way to attain it is laid plain before you?</p>
                  <p>Say (I pray) ſay in your hearts, ſay before God, Would you not? Do you not deſire to live a life of holineſſe, a life of ſpiritual peace, comfort and joy, a life of happineſſe under the warm, moſt refreſhing beams of Gods face and favour? Would you not? Wiſh you not that you may live for ever with Chriſt in glory, when your natural life ſhall end? Doth not thy heart ſometimes (at leaſt ſay) O that my Soul may go into life when my body ſhall dy, and that my body may be raiſed to the reſurrection of life? Some (poſſibly) may think it ſtrange that I propound ſuch queries, ſaying in themſelves, who is there but would, and deſireth ſo to live? I anſwer, well is it for thoſe who have a thorow will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thereto, for they will undoubtedly induſtrouſly ſeek to walk in the way of life, they will hearken to this counſel, and make it their ſtudy and buſineſſe to mortifie their ſin through the ſpirit. It was the ſaying of one (as I have read) that he would ſwim through a Sea of Brimſtone to get to heaven; ſtrong deſires cauſeth ſtrong endeavours, and carrieth through
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97673:92"/>great difficulties, hunger (we ſay) breaketh through ſtone walls, but if thy heart be right, that which is required of thee, being to be done through the ſpirit, is not of extream difficulty. I beſeech you, what think you, hath that man a mind to live in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, who will not ſeek the life of his deadly enemies, who unleſſe deſtroyed, will ſurely deſtroy him? Or, who will not give himſelf to the uſe of good and effectuall means preſcribed to him, for the removing a diſeaſe, or healing of a wound, which unleſſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red will certainly be his death? verily, no more have they a thorow, ſound will, or fervent deſire to live ſpiritually, happily and eternally, who hearing what muſt be done in order thereunto, caſt the counſell of God behind their back, not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up themſelves to the obedience thereof. But wilt thou O Soul be ſo unwiſe? be not thou (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any other is) ſo fooliſh as not to thirſt after ſuch life. If thou ſayeſt thou doſt long for it, ſhew the truth and ſtrength of thy deſire, by thy diligence in practiſing daily this exhortation; which if thou doſt not, but ſhalt neglect and deſpiſe inſtruction, then truly thou wilt not can'ſt not live, that's implyed, (when it's ſaid, <hi>He that doth this ſhall live</hi>) he that doth it not ſhall not live. <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Lot's wife;</hi> So remember other Scripture exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, particularly that, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.35. <hi>One of the Sons of the Prophets, ſaid to his neighbour in the word of the Lord, ſmite me I pray thee, and the man refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſmite him, then ſaid the Prophet, becauſe thou haſt not obeyed the voice of the Lord, as ſoon as thou art departed from me, a Lyon ſhall ſlay thee,</hi> and it was ſo, as ſoon as the man was departed from him, a <hi>Lyon ſound him, and ſlew him;</hi> So it's ſaid to thee this day in the word of the Lord, ſmite I pray thee, kill, deſtroy thy ſin, if thou refuſeſt, then ere long
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97673:93"/>(thou knoweſt not how ſoon) a Lion will ſlay thee, thy luſt, and Satan that devouring Lion, yea the wrath of the Almighty worſe than a thouſand Lions will ſlay thee with a ſlaughter far more terrible and dreadfull, than that was, wherewith that man was ſlain; thou wilt find and feel the truth of this, as he experienced to the loſſe of his life the truth of the Prophet's word. You may alſo obſerve in the ſame Chapter <hi>V.</hi> 42. <hi>The Prophet ſaid to</hi> Ahab <hi>King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>(Thus ſaith the Lord) becauſe thou haſt let go out of thine hand, a man whom I appointed to utter deſtruction, therefore thy life ſhall go for his life.</hi> So aſſuredly, if thou ſhalt let thy ſin eſcape, which God hath appointed to utter deſtruction, in the ruining whereof thou mayeſt have the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, then ſhall thy life go for it's life. Muſt it not needs be ſo, if the not ſmiting a Prophet, when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, coſt a man his life, (againſt the doing of which he had a ſeeming fair objection and excuſe) if the not ſlaying <hi>Benhadad</hi> a King, when God would have him ſlain (though we read not God had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declared) coſt <hi>Ahab</hi> (a King) his life; then how ſure, the not ſlaying thy ſin, which God ſo oft calls upon thee, and preſſeth thee to mortifie, will coſt thee thy life? Fain would I (may it pleaſe the Lord to work) that this counſell may become river<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rooted in all our hearts. Therefore I ſhall hint a few moving perſwaſions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Set forth, up and be fighting couragiouſly and conſtantly againſt your corruptions, and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the ſpirit, ſo ſhall you have many victories, you will oft get the better of them, and every victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be a cordiall, a cup of conſolation to your hearts, much joy will you thereby have now, &amp; much more hereafter, when the fight ſhall be quite ended. Nothing gladdeth more in this world, than victory
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97673:93"/>over ſtrong mighty inveterate enemies, how did <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> rejoyce when they came off victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, with Palms in their hands, <hi>Jud.</hi> 5.1, 2. &amp;c. <hi>Then ſang</hi> Deborah <hi>&amp;</hi> Barak <hi>the ſon of</hi> Abinoam, <hi>on that day, ſaying, praiſe ye the Lord, for the avenging of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then they ſang, When? <hi>Ch.</hi> 4. laſt, <hi>The hand of the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>proſpered, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt</hi> Jabin <hi>the King of</hi> Canaan, <hi>untill they had destroyed</hi> Jabin <hi>King of</hi> Canaan, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as if it had been ſaid) that great, that potent deſtroying King <hi>Jabin,</hi> therefore his name is ſo repeated. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thou mayeſt ſing now, and much more hereafter, and ſing for ever, ſtir up thy ſelf, take hold of the Lord, march out againſt every ſin in his name and ſtrength, for ſo ſhalt thou prevail, be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. Read and conſider, weigh that well, <hi>Jud.</hi> 6.12, 13. <hi>The Angel of the Lord appeared to</hi> Gideon <hi>and ſaid unto him, the Lord is with thee, thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man of valour, Gideon</hi> replyed, <hi>Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befaln us?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>V.</hi> 14, 15, 16. <hi>And the Lord looked upon him, and ſaid, go in this thy might, and thou ſhalt ſave</hi> Iſrael <hi>from the hand of the</hi> Midianites: <hi>have not I ſent thee? and he ſaid, oh my Lord, wherewith ſhall I ſave</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Behold my family is poor in</hi> Manaſſeth (a poor Tribe) <hi>and I am the leaſt in my Fathers houſe, and the Lord ſaid unto him, ſurely I will be with thee and thou ſhalt ſmite the</hi> Midianites <hi>as one man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If God intend to ſave us, he will take ſome ſevere courſe, or other with us for the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſin, if we will not be perſwaded by fair means by his word, to ſeek it's deſtruction; whence was it that the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthan</hi> was delivered up to Satan, and thereupon had ſo much ſorrow, that he was ready to be ſwallowed up thereby, it vvas for the deſtruction of his ſin, the ruining vvhereof he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97673:94"/>the Pſalmiſt ſaith, fools becauſe of their tranſgreſſion are afflicted, becauſe they countenance their ſin and are too tender tovvards it, vvhich is their folly, therefore God makes them ſmart. Hence <hi>Davids</hi> bones vvere broken, becauſe he did not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the luſtfull motions that vvere in him, but gave vvay thereto. Remember vvhat Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten, be zealous therefore and repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What is the end, aim and tendency of every deed of the body of ſin, every ſinfull motion? It is your death, <hi>Abſtain,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, from fleſhly luſts which war againſt your ſouls,</hi> Why do they vvar? but to kill your ſouls, and ſo far as Satan hath a hand in ſtirring up your luſts, he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aims at your utter ruin; therefore ſeek the death of your luſts. Is it not better for ſin to dy, than for your ſouls to dy? No man can be ſo irrationall as to think and ſay plainly, that it's vvorſe for him to ſlay his ſin, than it vvill be to be ſlain by it. This is even the fartheſt ſtep from vviſdom, for any to pleaſe his fleſh, and Satan, his vvorſt enemies, to his ovvn eternall undoing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, While any ſin is in you unmortified you cannot be ſo uſefull to others; you'l not have a heart no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> capacity or fitneſſe to do that good you might in your generation, that you ſay or do vvill not be ſo advantagious to others: yea ſin being unmortified you vvill thereby do much hurt, by ſtumbling them, hardning them, cauſing them to blaſpheme (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> by his ſin opened the mouths of the enemies of the Lord in blaſpheming.) And hovv ſad is this, for a man that ought ſtill to do good, to do much hurt? for a man to be an inſtrument of Satan, as every one is, vvho doth hurt to others ſouls? it may be by ſome one corruption in you not ſubdued, but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97673:94"/>prevailing, you may be in a great degree a means, through your ill example, or otherwiſe, of the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of your Relations, Acquaintance, or ſuch with whom you have to do, certainly a man that underſtands himſelf, had rather lye rotting in the grave, than live to do miſchief, eſpecially ſo great hurt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, there cannot be the leaſt ſhew or ſhadow of reaſon why we ſhould ſpare any ſin. Good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there may be for a man to ſpare outward ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to do thoſe good who hate him: This may be an honour to a man (<hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is highly commended, for that when he was moved to execute one who reviled him, he ſaid that were it in his power, he had rather raiſe his dead enemies, than put to death his living.) Or there may be hope that a mans enemies will grow better in time if ſpared, or they living may be of ſome uſe one way or other, or ſome friends may interceed for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if you let go your ſin, this is the greateſt diſgrace, ſhame and diſhonour that can be to you; it's impoſſible ſin ſhould grow better, but the longer you let it live unmortified, it will ſtill grow worſe as to you. Sin it ſelf cannot be of any good uſe; There is no one who will be pleaſed by your ſparing ſin, unleſs you ſhall take Satan for your friend, or ſome one in whom he ruleth. Nor is there or can there be any other reaſon why you ſhould forbear, or defer to ſeek the death of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin.</p>
                  <p>Again, Conſider the ſmalleſt ſin not mortified, is far worſe than the greateſt groſſeſt ſin that hath never ſo oft broke forth, if it be at length brought under; for the leaſt deed of the body of ſin let alone is mortal to you, it will kill you; but the greateſt, being mortified, will be no bar to, or at all preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97673:95"/>your ſalvation; <hi>for if ye mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> how great, heinous, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, prevailing and provoking ſoever thoſe deeds have been.</p>
                  <p>Therefore be fully reſolved (through the ſpirit) to endeavour the death of every of your ſins, ſeeing ſin hath already done us ſo much hurt, by wounding, by defiling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſouls, by ſeparating between God and us, and cauſing many wayes much ſorrow to us, it is but juſt revenge to ſeek its death, it's ſaid indeed, <hi>avenge not your ſelves,</hi> but you know that is not ſpoken as to our ſins, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to deſtroy the <hi>Amalekits,</hi> and <hi>Midianites</hi> (when God commanded them) and that utterly becauſe of the hurt they had done to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Apoſtle makes <hi>holy revenge</hi> one ſign of true repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. How do wicked men mortifie the deeds of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, its motions and convictions, how much have we all been guilty thereof? O that for time to come, we may wholly addict our ſelves to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of the deeds of the body of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Remember, be you faithful in this combate for a while, and yet after a little time it will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly dead, and buried (as I may ſay) and that never to have any reſurrection; our viſible body ſhall riſe again, not the body of ſin, nor any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, when once quite deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here add three or four directions, beſides thoſe formerly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Look upon and account this to be one end of all Gods providences towards you, to ſtir you up to this duty; hence your afflictions which you (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) ſpeak of, as ſo many, ſo great, they <hi>are to take away your ſin,</hi> hence your mercies (which when feweſt and leaſt, are more and greater than your afflictions) they alſo are to excite you againſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97673:95"/>your ſins, for the goodneſs of God leadeth to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and if you thus account and reckon, it will be a good help to awaken you thereto, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>account that the long ſuffering of our Lord is ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> account ſo, thus think, and judge in your ſelves, but why ſhould we ſo account, becauſe this will be a means to put us upon our duty, as may appear by the 14 v. upon which he brings in that exhortation, <hi>be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without ſpot and blameleſs,</hi> then comes in that, as a help thereunto, <hi>and account that the long-ſuffering of God is ſalvation,</hi> do ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you will be quickned to be diligent that you may be found of him in peace, ſo you ſhould account of all God's providences, they are ſalvation, in order to the ſalvation of your ſouls, and conſequently to the deſtruction of your ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Think not a little pains enough for the mortifying any ſin; though all our pains be nothing without the ſpirit, yet the ſpirit will have us not only to do, but to do with all our might. There muſt be <hi>violence</hi> uſed againſt our ſin, which Chriſt teacheth, when he ſaith, <hi>cut off thy right hand, right foot, and pluck out thy right eye that offends thee,</hi> touching it, a little ſmiting it is not enough, it muſt be cut off, and pluck'd out, all that we do ſhould be done with all our might, much more this. If we did ſtrive more, the Spirit would help us more, But,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let nothing quiet thee unleſs thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells thee thou art hearty and zealous in this work, and doſt get ſome ground upon thy ſin, it's croſs to Scripture for a man under the power of ſin, (he not bearing up and wreſtling ſincerely and ſtoutly againſt it) to bleſs himſelf in, or quiet himſelf by any thing; and this hardens the heart,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97673:96"/>nouriſheth ſin, ſtrengthneth and increaſeth it, when a man upon any account, <hi>ſpeaks peace to his ſoul while he lives in ſin,</hi> hence that terrible word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.20. <hi>God ſaith his anger and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man</hi> (who giving way to ſin, bleſſeth himſelf) <hi>and all the curſes ſhall lye upon him,</hi> &amp;c. if a man flatter himſelf that he ſhall do well, becauſe he hath had ſuch comforts, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch duties, God is merciful, Chriſt hath dyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though he live after the fleſh in this or that evil deed or motion thereof, then will that man's ſin prevail more and more, and it's not like to be mortified, or that he ſhould ſeek the mortification thereof.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Beware of all leſſening and extenuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts of your ſin; to beget ſuch thoughts in us, is Satan's way to defend our ſin, and deaden our hearts to the ſeeking the death thereof, as that we cannot help it, (which is no extenuation but an aggravation of ſin, when it ariſeth from the ſtrength of ſin in our hearts, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. it's expreſs'd to aggravate, or ſhew the greatneſs of their ſin, <hi>they cannot ceaſe to ſin</hi>) or that our ſin is not ſo great as ſome others (<hi>I am not,</hi> ſaid the Phariſee, <hi>like this Publican</hi>) or I have ſuch a temptation (the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaid, Adam <hi>thou gaveſt me, ſhe gave me, and I did eat</hi>) or any other excuſe, while a man's mind is ſo exerciſed and buſied to make his ſin appear as little as poſſibly he can, it roots and grows in him; he'l not ſtrike hard at it, if he think it ſmall; he'l give it a weak blow, if he think it weak; no great ſtroke, if he imagine it not to be great, as if a man be to kill a little creature (a flye ſuppoſe) he'l put forth but little ſtrength, for that he thinks enough. Labour therefore to ſee your ſin as it is in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, heinouſneſs, and utmoſt ſinfulneſs ſo far as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97673:96"/>may be; and for that purpoſe, view your ſin in the glaſs of the word, ſee how it's ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>th there in the word of truth, applying all that's ſpoken againſt ſuch and ſuch a ſin to your ſin, that ſin in you, — conſider how it is in God's eye, how he looks upon it, as alſo how it will appear to you, when you come to dye, or ſtand in judgment; and lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k round it, weigh the aggravating circumſtances of it, the love, the goodneſs of God to you, your knowledge, means of ſanctification, and checks of conſcience, your profeſſion, your hope, your prayers, with other ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. All you who do mortifie your ſin in truth, through the Spirit, be aſſured this day you ſhall live; for you to believe is as really your duty, as it is for you to do any thing againſt your ſin, and the more you believe it, the more will you do againſt ſin; a man may conceit he ſhall live, and therefore let his ſin live; but he that hath a true faith ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Word of God, particularly my Text, that he ſhall live, he'l become thereby more induſtrious in warring againſt ſin, for faith is a purifying grace. Believe then, live you ſhall, ſpiritually, while you live naturally, if at preſent you have not, you ſhall have peace and joy.</p>
                  <p>God's favour is towards you, and you ſhall have a ſenſe of it, if now you are without it, and eternal life is yours, you are heirs of it. Dye you may a natural, but not a curſed death, not the ſecond death, as ſhe ſaid, who going cheerfully to Priſon, and hearing one ſay to her, you have not yet taſted death, true anſwered ſhe, nor ever ſhall I, for Chriſt ſaith, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 8.51. <hi>if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall not ſee death,</hi> ſo you who keep this ſaying, ſhall not ſee death, but you ſhall ſee life and enjoy it for ever, <hi>you are written among the living in</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97673:97"/>
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.3. or (as it's otherwiſe read) <hi>you are written unto life,</hi> your names are in the <hi>book of life,</hi> ſee by faith, there is a book of life, where the names of all that ſhall live are fairly indelibly recorded, and among others, there even there ſtands thy name, your mortifying your ſin through the Spirit, is a ſure evidence to you hereof, therefore by it, mortifie your doubts, and let your aſſurance be raiſed, and let it give life to your hearts, even the life of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; This promiſe ye ſhall live, contains in it more than tongue can expreſs, it is comprehenſive of all you deſire, or can reaſonably wiſh for, Let not thy ſoul refuſe to be comforted by it, it matters not much what now is, think thou of what ſhall be. Now, thou mayeſt be as dead as to thy name, eſtate, health, this or that good, but doubt not, thou ſhalt live, ſo live, that there ſhall not any ſhadow of death remain in thee, upon, or to thee.</p>
                  <p>You may ſay, this is a good word to them who can rightly apply it, and me thinks I could drink in the comfort of it abundantly, did I know it belongs to me, but I fear whether I do truely mortifie my ſin through the ſpirit, or no.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, the Apoſtle ſpake this by the Spirit, which had never moved him ſo to ſpeak had it not been a thing knowable, it's manifeſt this may be known, and queſtionleſs they who have the help of the Spirit in mortifying their ſin, may (if they have not) have the teſtimony of it, that they ſo do. who helping his friend in any great work, is unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould know it?</p>
                  <p>A few things I ſhall propound over and above what you have heard, that may be ſomewhat help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you in your knowing this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Is your eye much upon your ſin, is it much in your thoughts, eſpecially your chief iniquity; have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97673:97"/>you many thoughts of that, is your mind much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon it? <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.3. <hi>my ſin is ever before me.</hi> When a man ſights againſt an enemy, he keeps him in his eye, looks ſtedfaſtly on him; ſo he that is bent upon the mortifying his ſin, hath his thoughts much on it, not as ſome to be pleaſed therewith, but ſo as to grieve for it, to ſigh becauſe of it, and to conſider what he ſhould do for the preventing and deſtroying it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Doth the breaking forth of ſin and your being at any time maſtered hy it, ſadden your hearts, as really and more than affliction? ſickneſs cauſeth ſadneſs, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Why is thy countenance ſad, ſeeing thou art not ſick?</hi> ſo doth other affliction, but nothing ſaddeneth one who is intent and heartily engaged in war, ſo much as the prevailing of the enemy; if that queſtion ſhould be put to a gracious perſon, why is thy countenance ſad, ſeeing thou art not ſick, nor in other great affliction, he could oft anſwer, it is becauſe of my ſin that hath prevailed againſt me, though my body be not ſick, my ſoul (which is worſe) alas that is ſick through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of this or that iniquity. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (upon occaſion) gives us a large relation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his exceeding great ſufferings, but ſaith not becauſe of them, but becauſe of his ſin, O wretched man that I am. Now, can you ſay? the breaking forth of worldlineſs, troubles me more than the loſs of the world; the prevailing of pride, grieveth me more than contempt and diſgrace; my neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew love and kindneſs to others, afflicteth me as really, as much and yet more than others not ſhewing love and kindneſs to me; the diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Spirit, lyeth heavier upon me, than any worldly diſappointment, and the like; this is a good demonſtration that you mortifie your ſin
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97673:98"/>through the Spirit, and the more, if you can ſay the very ſtirring and moving of ſin in you ſadneth you heart, though it do not outwardly ſhew it ſelf, and is known to none, but God alone.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The more ſin is mortified in any, are they the dearer to you? or the more you perceive any are careful and watchful againſt ſin, doth your heart go forth the more in love and affection to them? It may be the leſs this or that ſin appeareth in another, which is contrary to your temper, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or intereſt, the more you may love him, and yet be under the power of your ſin, but if your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be drawn out to others according as you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to be engaged againſt all their ſin, this ſpeaks well, and the ſign is the clearer, if you do in your hearts eſteem and rejoyce in ſuch who have got a greater conqueſt over their ſin, than you have yet attained to.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is a hopeful evidence, if you have much tenderneſs towards ſuch who are ſtrugling and ſtriving againſt their ſin, when you ſee them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times foiled thereby, yet it appearing that they do wreſtle againſt their ſin, your hearts are full of pitty towards them, you have a tender reſpect to them, and bear them upon your hearts before God. When any are ſeen to be favourers of their ſin, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that they nouriſh or countenance a luſt, then your hearts are offended, and riſe againſt them upon that account, but for thoſe who are enemies to their ſin, theſe you compaſſionate, this ſpeaks you know what it is to fight againſt ſin, and that the Spirit acts you therein.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is a good mark, if you have ſtrong breathings after the motions of the Spirit, if you long much for its moving in ordinances, and that in order to the deſtroying your corruptions. O that the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97673:98"/>holy mighty Spirit, would move and work in this and the other duty, that my ſin may have ſome dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blow thereby; and it this be one principall thing you look at in all your duties, and waiting on God in Ordinances that through the Spirit, your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be mortified. I ſhall now only give a ſhort anſwer to three Objections, and conclude this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſhut up this Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. Some ſincere heart may object, were my ſin quite ſubdued, I ſhould not doubt, but wo is me, it liveth ſtill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. Abraham <hi>offered</hi> Iſaac, yea it is there repeated, <hi>he offered up his only begotten ſon,</hi> yet his ſon lived ſtill, How ſo? becauſe in his will he did actually offer him at God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and went a great way in offering him, he took his ſon, bound him, and having built an Altar, and laid on wood, he laid his ſon thereon and took his knife in his hand, and had gone farther, had not God ſtopt him. So if thy heart be indeed ſet againſt ſin, and they will, thy purpoſe and reſolution be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to ſlay thy ſin, and thou goeſt as far as ever thou canſt therein, though as yet it have life, thy ſin may be ſaid to be mortified, yea altogether ſo, as to thy will, thy deſire and purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. I have a long time laboured againſt this and that ſin, yet doth it oft get the maſtery of me, it hath much life, much livelineſſe and ſtrength after years ſtrugling againſt it, had I the ſpirit helping me, ſure I ſhould before this, have gotten, if not a perfect, yet a greater victory over my ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> When an enemy prevails frequently, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and holds out long, very long, it's more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him that continues fighting againſt him, when at laſt conquereth that his enemy; and this gives good hope the ſpirit doth help thee that thou
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97673:99"/>haſt ſo long wreſtled againſt thy corruption, and yet holdeſt on, thou fainteſt nor, but maintaineſt the fight, ſighing crying, out againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. But I ſee that ſome have got much more ground upon their ſin, and have it more under than I have, though they began the fight, a good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's good to be lowly minded, to think others better than thy ſelf, but perhaps their ſin whom thou thinkeſt of, may have more ſtrength than thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; or though one fin be leſſe in them than in thee, another may be leſſe in thee than in them; or thou mayeſt have done much more againſt thy ſin than they, though it break forth more in thee; yea, thou mayeſt in a great degree have mortified thy ſin, and ſome who ſeem to have out gone thee in mortification have done nothing in it to purpoſe; either becauſe thy temptations are ſtronger, or thy diſadvantage greater through naturall weakneſſe, badneſſe of conſtitution, bodily diſtemper, want of ſuch educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſome other cauſe. Many a man whoſe ſin ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had one wound, or ſtroke towards it's death, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſined to appearance outwardly ſo much as <hi>Lot, Noah, David, Jonah, Peter</hi> and others in whom ſin was truly mortified. Some ground through it's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural quality, or becauſe more dunged or better wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, may have it's weeds oft cut down, and yet at times have more than another piece of ground which was never weeded at all. The not knowing or not conſidering ſuch things makes ſome go bleſſing themſelves to Hell, and others to go trembling to Heaven, and cauſeth divers to become exceeding guilty by their ſelf conceitedneſſe, and proud cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
